            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE TRANSLATOR's PREFACE.</head>
            <p>SInce Practical Sciences are infinitely more uſeful to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, than the moſt Curious ſpeculations; Doubtleſs, the <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>Phyſic</hi> may juſtly claim the ſame Privilege, with reſpect to its Theoric Companions. <hi>Anatomy, Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Botany,</hi> and the whole Circle of Sciences that retain to <hi>Phyſic,</hi> are only ſerviceable when they conſpire to improve a regular and ſafe <hi>Practice.</hi> When they carry on any differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent deſign, their Poſitions are deſervedly neglected as idle and uſeleſs Curioſities. The only plea they can make, is, the Diverſion and Entertainment of a few whoſe Heads are turned that way. Whereas, the Advantage and Benefit of the World is the Reſult of Practical Truths.</p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this Account, I choſe to abridge <hi>Etmullerus</hi> his <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>Phyſic,</hi> as being the center and ſubſtance of all his Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances. The Choice was determin'd by the Advantage which accrues to the Theory in being applied to Practice, and back'd by Experience, without which no Argument is good; in being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd in ſuch a method as muſt naturally ingroſs all its uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and inſtructing Part, and leave out what is only Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for Diverſion and Pleaſure. Thus, 'tis reſtor'd to its Natural tendency, and ſtamp'd with an inviting Character.
<pb facs="tcp:207638:4"/>'Tis clear'd of the Crimes that are charg'd upon frivolous ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceties, and recommended to the World as a ſubſtantial and neceſſary part of Phyſic.</p>
            <p>Had this method been always follow'd, it had prevented a great many Inconveniences; as it will appear by the following Inſtances. Moſt of our Courſes of Practice are ſtuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d with the Nauſeous Repetition of ineffectual Med'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines. Their unexperienc'd Authors deliver their miſtaken notions as a ſtanding Rule, and with an aſſuming Air pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Dictat to Experience. So great is the <hi>Self-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency</hi> of a teeming, Brain, and ſuch is the Conſequence of that unhappy Diſtinction between the <hi>Theory</hi> of Diſeaſes, and Actual Practice; By this means Various Sects ariſe, Their reſpective Votaries become Phyſicians by Eccho and form their precarious methods from the <hi>Placita</hi> of Opinionative Men: The m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt ſolid and uſeful Poſitions are miſconſtru'd, or wrangl'd away; and plain Practice is confronted by vain fancies, or run down by the humor and byaſs of a Party.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, a certain ſet of Men, diſoblig'd by the ſtiffneſs of the ſpeculative Tribe, and their ſmall regard to Experience, have choſe to lay aſide all the advantages of (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven uſeful) Theory, and truſt wholly to the Conduct of an Ignorant Experience. Thus Med'cines, that in a few ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Inſtances have been Crown'd with ſucceſs, are recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended as infallible in all Diſeaſes of the like form. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, were theſe Empyric Pretenders acquainted with the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Cauſes of the ſame effect, and the peculiar Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men, they would be able to ſingle out the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Caſes in which their Med'cines are proper, and ſecond 'em with ſolid Reaſons. But they fooliſhly diſdain the leaſt Tincture of Knowledge; they boldly decry what they do not underſtand: and with a ſucceſsful impudence, impoſe upon a Credulous World.</p>
            <p>Now the reſult of all, is, that a happy Conjunction of Speculative and Experimental <hi>Knowledge,</hi> is the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of the Inconveniences that Cramp a regular <hi>Practice.</hi> And 'tis in great meaſure, accompliſh'd in the following ſheets: Here the orderly Scheme of the functions of the
<pb facs="tcp:207638:4"/>Body, The General Claſſes and Vertues of Medicines, and their forms of Preſcription, are briefly accounted for, in few Preliminary Chapters. Here the Reader will meet with the Spirit and Perfection of Practice, ſupported by all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ful diſcoveries of <hi>Anatomy,</hi> and <hi>Chymy,</hi> and a Judicious Account of the <hi>Materia Medica.</hi> Here the nicest <hi>Phyloſopher</hi> will find entertainment anſwerable to his humor; and the meaneſt <hi>Empyric,</hi> will be Accommodated with ſuitable Inſtruction. Our Author omits nothing that may promote the Grand deſign. He reaſons with the manly force and Dexterity of a Philoſopher, and yet ſtoops to the meaneſt stroke of unaccountable <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> He weighs all the Inſtances of <hi>Quack-Cures,</hi> even <hi>Sympathy</hi> it ſelf he pay's a deference to, and chooſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to check the moſt refin'd reaſon, than controul matter of fact. He traces the Ancients to their earlyeſt date, and omits no piece of Modern Diſcovery. He Reconciles the Experience of former Ages, with the improvements of lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Authors. He unites the jarring Hypotheſes of <hi>Willis, Sylvius</hi> and <hi>Helmont;</hi> and makes 'em conſpire to illuſtrat and imbelliſh an uniform Practice.</p>
            <p>In the Diviſion of Diſeaſes he chooſes to follow the moſt Natural method, in ranking 'em with the functions of the Body, and fetching in the Stragglers to the place where their cauſe is lodg'd. In this he was oblig'd to depart from the ordinary meaſures of our <hi>Common-Place Writers,</hi> who ſplit diſeaſes as their effects va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, and multiply 'em according to the Number of their Symptoms. By ſo doing he avoid, the Inconvenience of Charging our memories with multiplyed Cures, that may be compaſs'd by one method. As for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, he fetches the cauſe of all <hi>Chronical</hi> Diſeaſes from the Stomac; and with one Blow Cuts off the Prepoſterous plea of Obſtructions in the Bowels, and a Numberleſs train of Symptoms. Nay, he Penetrates into the hidden ſource of moſt of our Northern Diſeaſes; and by accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for that l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pps off a great deal of unneceſſary <hi>Practice:</hi> As it appears by his method of Curing Children's Diſtempers; which has already met with a welcome reception from the Engliſh World.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:207638:5"/>
            <p>But, 'tis a needleſs piece of formality, to anticipat the Reader's Curioſity with a Character of the Book or Author. His Name is an Ample Recommendation. His Works (in the Language of the Learned) have been receiv'd both here and abroad, with the unanimous Approbation of the beſt Judges; and have justly Entitled him to the Character he bears in the Title-Page of their Laſt Edition at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> viz. <hi>Practicus per Omnem Europam Celeberrimus.</hi> His <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>Phyſic</hi> is doubtleſs the Compleateſt now extant: As being ſo admirably fitted for all the Meaſures of Theory and Practice. 'Tis Countenanc'd by <hi>Anatomy,</hi> Improv'd by <hi>Chymy,</hi> diſtinguiſh'd in the Minutest Circumſtances, warranted by Experience, and finiſh'd to the laſt Degree. His <hi>Method</hi> is <hi>Eaſy;</hi> The <hi>Cauſes</hi> he aſſigns to Diſeaſes are <hi>Natural,</hi> his <hi>Reaſons</hi> Convincing, his <hi>Proofs</hi> Solid, his <hi>Cautions</hi> Seaſonable, his <hi>Obſervations</hi> Juſt, his <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments</hi> true, His <hi>Vouchers</hi> Men of Credit, his <hi>Med'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines</hi> Nicely Prepar'd, and all his <hi>Compoſitions</hi> admirably well Contriv'd. In a word, every Period of his Writings may furniſh us with convincing Proofs of his Infinit <hi>Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> clear <hi>Apprehenſion,</hi> ſolid <hi>Judgment,</hi> large <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and unſully'd <hi>Integrity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Abridgment, or <hi>Tranſlation;</hi> I ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trouble the Reader nor my ſelf with any Apology for it. If the Imperfections are only ſuch, as, the hurry of the Preſs, the Injunctions of Bookſellers, the limited Number of ſheets, and the Common plea of overſights may account for, I have ſome Title to beſpeak forgiveneſs of the Reader. If it be juſtly charg'd with groſſer faults, I can offer no deference that's ſufficient.</p>

               <head>THE <hi>INTROD<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CTION.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HAving undertaken to compile a Syſtem of Phyſic, I am oblig'd, in the firſt place, to diſtinguiſh the <hi>Common</hi> and <hi>Ordinary</hi> Practice from that which is <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncommon</hi> and <hi>Extraordinary.</hi> The former is, as yet, very Lame, by reaſon of the Scarcity of Chymical and Anatomical Experiments; which occaſions our Ignorance of the Radical Cauſes of Diſeaſes, and leaves on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome occaſional Symptoms to build the Theory upon. Nor is it leſs deficient in Generous and Proper Remedies, which might effectually accompliſh the Deſign, with leſs Violence and Torture to the Stomach; Such as <hi>Paracelſus, Helmont,</hi> and other Noted Chymiſts have diſtinguiſh'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:207638:11"/>
               <p>The <hi>Extraordinary Practice</hi> differs from the former, both in the Nature of its Remedies, which are all <hi>Arcana</hi>'s, tho otherwiſe never ſo common: And in the manner of their Operation, which is generally perform'd by Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, Inchantment, or ſome ſuch Secret way. This I reſerve to the Latter End; and ſhall now confine my ſelf to the <hi>Ordinary</hi> Practice, which I endeavour to make as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and compleat as poſſible, both in its conformity to Chymical and Anatomical Obſervations, and in the choice of Genuin and Proper Remedies.</p>
               <p>I propoſe to diſcourſe of All Diſeaſes incident to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Bodies: And in Tracing every Diſeaſe, ſhall obſerve the following method.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> To give the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the Diſeaſe, the Manner of its Invaſion, and the <hi>Signs</hi> which generally accompany it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> To deſcribe the <hi>Part affected,</hi> whether medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly, by being influenc'd from another; or immediatly, by the Reſidence of the <hi>Morbific Cauſe</hi> within its ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Cauſes</hi> of every Diſtemper, both <hi>Radical</hi> and <hi>Occaſional.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> What <hi>Prognoſtics</hi> we can have of the Event of every Diſtemper.</p>
               <p>And, <hi>Fifthly,</hi> To ſubjoyn the Method of Cure, both Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and Special; the Nature of the Remedies, whether Simple or Compound, Univerſal or Specific: Together with Hiſtorical Caſes, and Practical Obſervations applied to every Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>But ſome things are neceſſary to be premis'd, before we launch into the Practice.</p>
               <p>Whoever would underſtand it thoroughly, muſt be well acquainted with the Principles of <hi>Chymy</hi> and <hi>Mechanicks.</hi> The former are ſerviceable in explaining the Vital Functions of the Body, and the latter in the Animal Muſculary Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For Nature has acted Geometrically in framing our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as well as in every thing elſe.</p>
               <p>The remaining Preliminary Principles that a Student ought to know, before he Commence the Practice of Phyſic, are briefly couch'd under the following Heads.</p>

                  <p>AS the Oeconomy of Man's Body is only explicable by the different Forms, Sizes, and Various Combinations of the Minute Particles, of which every Body is compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, according to the Principles of <hi>Mechaniſm:</hi> So the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of Medicines may beſt be deduc'd from the ſame Cauſe: Eſpecially ſince Occult Qualities are now hiſs'd out of Doors; and the four firſt Elementary Principles of <hi>Cold, Hot, Dry</hi> and <hi>Moiſt,</hi> are more Imaginary than Real. This Particular Diſpoſition and Texture of Parts, that entitles all Medicines to their Reſpective Specific Qualities, is Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally owing to the Seed; and may properly be call'd the <hi>Seminal Diſpoſition.</hi> As for Example, Scurvygraſs is a <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific</hi> againſt the Scurvy; not becauſe it is Hot, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys ſuch an Occult Quality; but becauſe it enjoys ſuch a Texture of Parts, that makes it a ſubtil penetrating Body, fit for altering and ſubduing the Acid Scorbutical Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Now its preciſe <hi>Seminal Vertue</hi> is not Common to all its Parts, but peculiar to a ſharp Volatil Salt, couch'd within its Body, that actuates the other Earthy Particles. And indeed the Various Exaltation, or Depreſſion of Acid or Alcali Salts, is the diſtinguiſhing Character of all their reſpective Textures; becauſe the Saline Particles are more active, and produce more Notable Effects than any of the reſt; tho 'tis probable all of 'em Originally may have ſprung from Water.</p>
                  <p>Thus, ſuch Med'cines were by the Ancients accounted <hi>Hot,</hi> as by their ſharp pointed Particles affect the Tongue and Palate, the ſame way as Fire is wont to do; or by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a Volatil Oily Salt, diſſolve the Maſs of Blood, and augment its Fermentation. Thoſe of a contrary Vertue they ſtyi'd <hi>Cold;</hi> Such are all Acid or Nitrous Medicines. Thoſe they call'd <hi>Dry,</hi> which either drink in the moiſture of the Body, as Burnt Harts-horn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or open a Door for its Paſſage, as all <hi>Sudorifics.</hi> Thoſe <hi>Moiſt,</hi> that either ſupply moiſture, as all Nouriſhing and Liquid Things; or give a ſtop
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:207638:12"/>to its Conſumption, as Quieting, Pacific Medicines.</p>
                  <p>All Med'cines fit for Conquering a prevailing Acid, or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cali, in the firſt Paſſages, were by the Ancients call'd <hi>Ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritive.</hi> I chooſe rather to Chriſten 'em <hi>Alterative.</hi> If they are <hi>Anti-Acids,</hi> they perform their Task by imbibing the peccant Acid, as Steel and all Earths; or qualifying its ſharpneſs, as Oily fat Medicines; or fermenting with it, ſo as to work it into a Third Compound, as all Aſcali's, both Fix'd and Volatil. If their buſineſs be to conquer Alcali's, they reduce the Bile, or any other Vicious Alcali, to its true Temperature, by oppoſing themſelves to their Extremes. For 'tis the Diſproportion'd Mixture of the Juices, in the firſt ways, that deſtroys the Natural Fermentation of the Blood, and is the Source of all Chronical Diſtempers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, but falſely, imputed to Obſtructions. And all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies capable of reducing them from either Extreme, are what I call <hi>Alteratives</hi> in General; But are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd by ſeveral particular Names correſponding to their ſpecial Qualities. As thoſe of an Oily Mucilaginous Body, and free from any Predominant ſalt, are call'd <hi>Softening, Suppurating, Expectorating, Incraſſating, Anodyne,</hi> &amp;c. Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to them are the <hi>Astringents,</hi> of a Styptic, Auſtere Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Compounded of Earth and an Acid Salt, which thicken fluid humors, and eontract the fibres of the Parts, as Allum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thoſe that are moſt Famous for making head againſt Acids, are ſometimes term'd <hi>Febrifuga</hi>'s, by reaſon of their Noted Vertue in Intermitting Feavers; and ſometimes <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerary,</hi> by reaſon of their healing Vertue. Such as have a ſharp penetrating Salt, whether <hi>Acid</hi> or <hi>Alcali,</hi> are <hi>Attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating, Diſcuſſing,</hi> &amp;c. Thoſe endow'd with a Volatil Oily Salt, a piercing Smell, and a grateful Taſte, are <hi>Aromatic, Carminative, Cephalic,</hi> &amp;c. and are commonly us'd for Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials. Thoſe of a Volatil Salt, apt to diſſolve the Maſs of Blood, are <hi>Diuretic, Sudorific</hi> and <hi>Alexipharmacal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are the General Claſſes of all remedies us'd in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic. Such of 'em as are more Univerſal, and Anſwer more Indications are to be moſt eſteem'd. As Opium, <hi>Sal vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Oleoſum,</hi> and the fix'd Sulphurs of Minerals and Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals; which are all uſeful in an infinity of Caſes; and are upon that account Entitled to a preference, before others of a narrower extent.</p>

                  <p>HAving touch'd upon the Vertues of Medicines and their manner of Operation, the next thing is to conſider the Subject or Body upon which the Operation is perform'd. Its ſtructure preſents us with ſome groſs material Parts, and ſome more ſubtile and active, which ſerve to inform and actuate the other. The former repreſent the External Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bric of an Ingenious Machine; the latter the Internal Wheels and Springs of Motion.</p>
                  <p>The Ancients imagin'd our groſſer part to be compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the four firſt Elements, but without either Reaſon or Experience. I deny not but that there are ſuch things as Water, Earth and Air, which make up the greateſt part of our Terraqueous Globe; but I doubt much, if they and fire are the firſt and ſimpleſt Ingredients of all Compounds.</p>
                  <p>Indeed as to Water, I do not diſpute the point. Thales and Helmont have clearly made it out, that all things conſiſt of Water. But as for fire, the Modern Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments do ſufficiently prove, that 'tis nothing elſe but a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the ſmaller Particles of fat Acids, ſuch as we call ſulphurous, by means of the Air; from whence heat and light muſt neceſſarily enſue. We ſee that flame is only a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rarefaction of the ſame Particles that, when more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſated, appear in ſmoak; and a little more Condenſation converts ſmoak into ſoot; and the Oyl of Soot, which is a fat Acid, differs from all the three, as they from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by a further or leſſer degree of Rarefaction or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſation. Thus the Various Conjunction, Separation, or Tranſpoſition of the ſame Minute Particles, is the Original of the Generation and Corruption of different Bodies. Therefore our modern Philoſophers have thought fit to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the common Elementary Road, and ſearch for the Elements of Bodies among theſe minute particles, which by combining or ſeparating from one another, in greater or leſſer proportions, alter the Conſtitutions of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:207638:13"/>and transform 'em into others of a different mould. <hi>See the Houourable Mr.</hi> Boyl <hi>of the Original of Forms and Qualities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As I take it, theſe Particles that enter into the Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Bodies, and are the moſt immediat Elements into which they reſolve, may be juſtly divided into four Claſſes. 1. The Saline Particles which are either Acids, Alcali's, or Nitrous. 2. The Fat Oyly Parts. 3. The Watery, and 4. The Earthy. Theſe I ſay, are the moſt immediat Principles of diſſolv'd Body's. I do not advance them for the firſt and ſimpleſt, nor for the laſt; for even theſe may be reſolv'd into others, and moſt of 'em into Water. Perhaps the Watery Particles have a better Title to that Character. The various twiſting of 'em together, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the reſpective ſeminal Vertue, may give riſe to moſt, if not all, Compounds; which diſſolve into Water a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, when the ſeminal Power ceaſes to operate.</p>
                  <p>Our Body is immediately fram'd of theſe four ſorts of Particles, eſpecially of Salt and Sulphur; which are the chief Ingredients of the Blood, Chyle and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Juices. The ſeminal Power determines 'em to ſuch a particular concretion as appears in our Organs; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Texture and Proportion eſtabliſh'd among 'em, is the Gauge and Meaſure of our Temperaments.</p>
                  <p>The Changes that happen to Bodies, are chiefly occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd by the Activity and Various Engagements of the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Particles. <hi>Fermentation</hi> and <hi>Efferveſcency,</hi> which are the moſt remarkable motions in our Bodies, are totally owing to them. The former, is an Inteſtine motion of the minute Particles, occaſion'd by the mutual Jarrs of Acid and Alcali ſalts, which diſturbs all the other parts, and terminates either in the final diſſolution of the Body, or ſuch an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, as a New Union and Temperature of the Salts may allow of. <hi>Efferveſcency</hi> or Boyling is a much ſtronger motion, occaſion'd by the greater Purity, and Sharpneſs of the Salts.</p>
                  <p>The more ſubtile penetrating parts of our Body are the Principle of Life and Action. When they ceaſe to perform their wonted motions, death takes place. Their regular and undiſturb'd motions are the meaſure of Health; and the leaſt diſorder among 'em is juſtly call'd a Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>They are nothing elſe but the Subtiler and more Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Parts of the Blood ſeparated in the Brain; which by Reaſon of their Activity are called Spirits, tho in effect
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:207638:13"/>material, diviſible and liable to Corruption. When they are mix'd with the Blood, and ſerve to enliven and exalt its Maſs, Accompanying it through all the Parts of the Body, they are call'd <hi>Vital</hi> Spirits, and are imploy'd in <hi>Vital</hi> Functions; but when they're Lodg'd in a different Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Confine 'emſelves to the Nerves and Brain, they are engag'd in the <hi>Animal</hi> faculty. In this Office they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the Bodies of Light, and are therefore call'd <hi>Incid;</hi> but in the other they, <hi>fire-like,</hi> exalt and elevate the Blood. <hi>Vid. Williſ. de Anim. Brutor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is nothing more Conducive to a regular Practice of Phyſic, than a right underſtanding of theſe two Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and the ſeveral diſorders they're obnoxious to. The <hi>Animal</hi> faculty depends upon the regular motion of the Spirits, and a ſound Conſtitution of the Brain and Nerves. This I deſign to treat of <hi>Annon.</hi> The <hi>Vital</hi> faculty conſiſts in the regular motion of the Blood, Chyle, and the other Juices. The external motion of the Blood is its Circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but its Inteſtine motion is what we call a Fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Both theſe muſt be preſerv'd in their due tenor.</p>
                  <p>The Encumbrances of Circulation are remov'd or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by Sudorifics, which attenuate and diſſolve the Blood; and put it into a ſwifter, but equal motion. But the more preſent relief is from Blood-letting; which leſſens the quantity of the Blood, and makes way for a freeer Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, by emptying the Veſſels; or to ſpeak with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients <hi>Evacuates</hi> and <hi>Ventilates</hi> the Blood. 'Tis indifferent what Vein be open'd, when we only deſign to evacuate or leſſen the quantity; for that will certainly follow, open what Vein ye will. So in a General <hi>Plaethora,</hi> all choice of Veins is ridiculous. But if there be any particular Infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that ſeizes only one particular Member, then indeed Caſes are alter'd. Not that I eſtabliſh, even then, any neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of diſtinguiſhing Veins in one and the ſame Member. As if there be an Indication for letting Blood in the Arm, I think 'tis much at one, whether the <hi>Cephalic, Median,</hi> or <hi>Baſilic</hi> Vein be opened. But 'tis chiefly in regard of the Superior and Inferior Regions of the Body, that a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence muſt be obſerv'd. The Heart is the Centre of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and divides the Upper Region from the Lower: Now if there happen any Inflammation in the Upper Parts, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Vein in the Lower Regions, as in the Foot, diverts the Blood; for the deſcending branch of the <hi>Aorta,</hi> being thereby in ſome meaſure empty'd, the blood will more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:207638:14"/>flow into it, than into the aſcending branch, where the Stoppage, or Inflammation blocks up its way. This is call'd an Univerſal Revulſion. A particular <hi>Revulſion,</hi> or <hi>Averſion,</hi> is when a Vein is opened in the ſame Region and Neighbourhood with the part affected; as if in a Quinſey they let blood in the Arm. If the very next Vein, or the Vein through which the ſtanding blood muſt naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Heart, be opened, 'tis call'd a <hi>Derivation.</hi> As in a Quinſey, we firſt make a <hi>General Revulſion</hi> by bleeding in the Foot, to divert the Univerſal Maſs of the blood from feeding the Inflammation. Then for a more particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion; we bleed in the Arm, in order to draw off the ſtagnating blood, through a Neighbouring Channel. If this do not take off the Inflammation quite, we breath a Vein under the Tongue, in order to diſengage and evacuate the ſtanding blood, that ought naturally to paſs that way. In this Senſe all theſe Celebrated Effects of blood-letting, are very conſiſtent with the Rules of Circulation; which, in the Senſe of the Ancients, were altogether unexplicable. But the Univerſal Revulſion muſt always lead the Van, for fear a particular one ſhould encreaſe the Inflammation, by invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the blood to the Adjacent Parts.</p>
                  <p>I'll only ſtay to preſent you with a Remarkable Inſtance of the bad Conſequences an ill-tim'd <hi>Averſion,</hi> or <hi>Derivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> may produce. I borrow it from <hi>Lindanus,</hi> in his Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Comment upon <hi>Hartman.</hi> A Surgeon of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> was ſeiz'd with an Inflammation in his Right Eye. He ſent for ſome Old Phyſician, that order'd him to be bled in the Right Arm: Accordingly he was bled, which ſenſibly Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the Inflammation. The next day the Oracle was conſulted again. He, to mend the matter, order'd him to be bled in the Left Arm; the Conſequence of which was, that his Left Eye was inflam'd, though formerly untouch'd. The Third Day, the Old Gentleman perſiſting ſtiffly in his wonted Courſe, order'd bleeding in the Right Arm again; the performance of which made him quite blind in the Right Eye. And afterwards, to make all Odds even, he was bled again in the Left Arm, which heighten'd the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the Left Eye to the laſt degree. In this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity he ſent for a more skilful Practitioner, who only let him blood in the Foot, and immediatly the Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion began to aſſwage. The cauſe of ſuch Accidents is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plain. For the quantity of the blood not being diminiſh'd before, and a Door being open'd to it in the Arm, it will
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:207638:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>naturally croud upwards, where meeting with Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Paſſages, it cannot but accumulate and augment the Inflammation. A Univerſal Revulſion in the oppoſite Region of the Body ought to have Uſher'd it in; which would have prevented all the Inconveniencies that happen'd. So much for the <hi>Circular</hi> motion of the Blood, and the means of preſerving or retrieving it.</p>
                  <p>The fermentation of the Blood is occaſion'd by the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Acid and Alcali ſalts, which entertain a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Intercourſe with the Sulphurous, Watry and Earthy Particles. The different Proportions eſtabliſh'd among 'em, by the Radical Power of the Seed, do vary this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is peculiarly Calculated for every individual temperament. This Idoſin, craſy, or Seminal property, is the Standard and Rule of the Natural fermentation. When it ſwerves from that, it is call'd, a <hi>Cacochymy,</hi> or Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Juices; which is nothing elſe but the diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and degeneracy of theſe Saline Particles, and the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular motions that enſue thereupon. If the prevalency of an Acid Salt have occaſion'd it, 'tis call'd an Acid deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Juices; if an Alcali or Urinous Salt, it goes by that Name. Theſe are the only poſſible cauſes of a <hi>Cace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymy.</hi> If either of theſe Predominant Salts be lodg'd in a Watry or Serous Humor, it gives riſe to a <hi>Catarrh,</hi> or ſerous Corruption. If the Humor be Phlegmatic and Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid, 'tis call'd <hi>Pituitous,</hi> or <hi>Chylous.</hi> The Melancholly <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cochymy</hi> of the Ancients is only a Predominant Acid, which muſt either be <hi>Serous</hi> or <hi>Pituitous,</hi> according to the humour in which 'tis ſeated. The <hi>Bilious,</hi> is a Volatile Oyly Salt degenerated from its Natural Symmetry. So all the different kinds may be reduc'd to theſe two Branches, of <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Alcali.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An <hi>Acid</hi> Depravation of the Juices, is occaſion'd by the Prevalency or Indiſpoſition of the Acid Salts. If they are too plentiful, they thicken the blood, and retard its Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. If they are otherwiſe corrupted, as too Rancid, Auſtere, or Viciouſly Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They create ſeveral irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar efferveſcencies in the blood, ſuch as we frequently meet with in Scorbutic and Hyſteric Conſtitutions. Theſe Corruptions of Acid Salts, may be owing to the Cold Air (which ſeems to be impregnated with a hidden Acid) Acid Food, or Liquors, Grief, Care, Sorrow, Neglect of Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and ſuch like Errors in the uſe of the <hi>ſix not Natural things;</hi> which either augment their quantity, or whet and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:207638:15"/>ſharpen 'em beyond their Natural State. The <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rinous</hi> or <hi>Alcalin</hi> Depravation, is occaſion'd by the diſproportion or corruption of the Volatil Urinous Salts, which, when mix'd with Sulphur, Compoſe the Bile. If they're too Copious in the Body, if too ſharp and pointed, if too Oyly or Fat, or otherwiſe degenerated from their Seminal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, they Create Infinite diſorders in the maſs of blood. Their Corruption may be owing to Aromatic, Sharp, or Penetrating Food, immoderate Watchings, Exerciſes, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and ſuch like Paſſions, which contribute to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Encreaſe or Depravation.</p>
                  <p>The General Cauſes of all <hi>Cacochymical</hi> diſpoſitions may be divided into three Claſſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The formal efficient cauſe of all diſeaſes is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; which, are equally the cauſe of all natural and unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural motions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The occaſional and material cauſe enclining and diſpoſing the Spirits to perform ſuch perverſe Actions; which according to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> is the Diſproportion and Intemperat quality of the minute Particles, that refuſe to Aſſimilate, or Incorporate with the Spirits, and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes 'em to irregular motions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The remote and mediat cauſe, is the Errors and Imperfections of Digeſtion, eſpecially of the firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd in the Stomac; which is the Foundation of all other Digeſtions, and, if deficient, perverts all the Juices in the Body.</p>
                  <p>The method of curing all <hi>Cacochymies,</hi> or, which is the ſame thing, all irregular fermentations in the blood, is firſt to retrieve the Natural qualities of the Juices and their minute Particles, by <hi>Altering Medicines,</hi> and then to <hi>Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate</hi> the Corrupt Juices to prevent any further In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. The general <hi>Alteratives</hi> are ſuch as Correct a pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Acid or Alcali, and reduce the Particles to their due Symmetry and Proportion. Beſides, there are ſome ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic <hi>Alteratives</hi> which are peculiarly Calculated for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Circumſtances of the Corrupt Acid or Alcali. For one Acid may differ vaſtly from another, according to the infinite ways of Corruption 'tis liable to, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently may produce very different, if not contrary, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. 'Tis true, we cannot have, <hi>à-priori,</hi> any Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiat account of their diſtinguiſhing Characters: but the effects they produce, and the influence of medicines atteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Experience, may lead unto know ſomewhat of their
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:207638:15"/>difference; and accordingly to diſtinguiſh the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifics that we find ſucceſsful in Vanquiſhing one ſort of Acids or Alcali's, but are not capable of gaining the like Victory over others of the ſame General Claſs. This may be ſet in a clearer light, by the following Example. 'Tis an unqueſtionable truth, that Pleuriſies, Stranguries, Ulcers in the Kidneys, Heart-Burn, Looſeneſſes, Gout, Gravel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may all be owing to Vicious Acids. The General <hi>Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> that are oppos'd to Acids are convenient in them all, and are fit to uſher in the ſpecific Cure; which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not of themſelves Compaſs. For 'tis not one and the ſame ſort of Acid, that is the Predominant in all theſe Inſtances. In one, 'tis an <hi>Acid</hi> that congeals the blood, and occaſions Pleuritick Pains; in another it is an <hi>Acid</hi> that ſharpens the Urine and Occaſions a Strangury; Accordingly we find that tho' all fix'd <hi>Alcali's</hi> are not inconvenient in Pleuriſies, yet the Powder of <hi>Boars</hi> Teeth and <hi>Pike</hi> Teeth, are ſpecific Antidots againſt that particular <hi>Acid</hi> that then prevails; as <hi>Crabs</hi> Eyes are in a Strangury. The like might be ſaid of all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>This conſideration <hi>Hippocrates</hi> had in his view, in his Incomparable Treatiſe <hi>de Veteri Medicina,</hi> where he paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onatly expells the general Elementary Qualities, both from the Theory and Practice of Phyſic; and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends to all Practitioners, as in a manner the whole of their buſineſs, to enquire nicely into the Subdiviſions and Specific differences of the General things; eſpecially to the difference of taſtes, whether Bitter, Sweet, Salt, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid, and a Thouſand ſuch marks of diſtinction, which are to direct us in the choice of ſuch Specific Remedies, as are peculiarly levell'd againſt the particular qualities of the morbific matter. Theſe you may expect in the ſeparat and particular deſcription of every diſeaſe, and the method of its Cure.</p>

With <hi>Spices, Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic</hi> herbs, ſuch as <hi>Mint, Fennel,</hi> &amp;c. And Oyly Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous medicines, that take off the edge of the Acid Parts. Some of theſe are prepared by <hi>Diſtillation,</hi> and ſome by <hi>Expreſſion;</hi> but the former are more effectual, ſuch as Spirit of <hi>Wine, Water-Creſſes, Scurvy-Graſs,</hi> &amp;c. And the Diſtill'd Oyls of <hi>Mace, Cloves,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Camphyr</hi> and its Productions belong to this Family.</p>
                  <p>In the Animal Claſs we have the Spirits and Volatil Salts extracted from the parts of Animals. Such as the Spirits of <hi>Hartſhorn, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, Sal armoniac,</hi> &amp;c. Which are of great uſe in all Acid Conſtitutions. The hard and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Parts of Animals are likewiſe very proper. As <hi>Crabs Eyes,</hi> Burnt <hi>Hartſhorn,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Mineral Province affords us very Powerful Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, not Inferior to thoſe of the other two. Such as are <hi>Diaphoretic Antimony,</hi> and the fix'd Sulphurs of other Minerals: Earths, Stones and Mettals, as Chalk, ſeal'd Earth, and ſeveral Metallic Productions. Whatever par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of Gold or Silver, is of noted excellency in ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inveterat Acids, that proceed from Wine, and are peculiar to Gouty Conſtitutions. Lead and its Salt, call'd <hi>Saccharum Saturni,</hi> have that property of aſſuming a ſweet taſte, when they meet with Acids, and are thereupon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to the Character of <hi>Alkali</hi>'s. But above all, Steel may juſtly claim a preference. And all remedies that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:207638:16"/>have it for their Baſis, are certianly the moſt Sovereign Conquerors of Acids.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the remedies we uſe for Correcting Acids in General, which may be preſcrib'd after this or the like manner.</p>
                  <p>Take of prepar'd <hi>Crabs Eyes,</hi> Red Coral prepar'd, burnt <hi>Hartſhorn</hi> of each a ſcruple, Salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> and <hi>Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> of each fifteen Grains, diſtill'd Oyl of <hi>Cloves</hi> and <hi>Cumin.</hi> of each twelve drops, and four or five Grains of <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> Prepar'd by fermentation. Mix all together; It will make a Powder for ſix or ſeven Doſes. Or,</p>
                  <p>Take of <hi>Crabs Eyes</hi> prepar'd a Dram and a half. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn Mineral,</hi> Red <hi>Coral</hi> prepar'd, and burnt <hi>Hartſhorn,</hi> of each half a Dram. Salt of <hi>Wormwood</hi> a Dram. Powder of <hi>Nutmegs</hi> two ſcruples. Mix all, and uſe it as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Powder. Or,</p>
                  <p>Take of Prepar'd <hi>Crabs Eyes</hi> a Dram, <hi>Cuttle-bone</hi> half a Dram, red <hi>Coral</hi> Prepar'd, and Chalk, of each a ſcruple. Salt of <hi>Wormwood</hi> two Scruples; <hi>Nutmegs</hi> half a Dram. Make a Powder to be us'd as before. Or,</p>
                  <p>Take of burnt <hi>Hartſhorn,</hi> or pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Theſe are to be us'd before Evacuation, in order to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify and prepare the peccant Acid.</p>
                  <p>Take Salt of <hi>Wormwood</hi> and <hi>Crabs Eyes</hi> prepar'd, of each half a Dram. Make a Powder for two Doſes.</p>
                  <p>Take of <hi>Carduus Benedictus</hi> and <hi>Fennel Water,</hi> of each an Ounce and a half. Spirit of <hi>Sal armoniac</hi> a Dram and a half, <hi>Crabs Eyes</hi> and Red <hi>Coral,</hi> prepar'd, of each fifteen Grains, Salt of <hi>Fumitory</hi> twelve Grains, diſtill'd Oyl of Cloves Six drops, Syrrup of Mint one Ounce. Mix them for a draught.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the common forms of Recipe's againſt Acids in General, but ſteel is a peculiar ſpecific for ſubduing an Acid in the firſt Paſſages.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes we meet with an <hi>Auſtere Hypochondriac,</hi> or <hi>Hyſteric</hi> Acid; which requires Volatil remedies. They may be preſcrib'd in this or the like form.</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Marjoram Water, Mint</hi> or <hi>Roſemary Water,</hi> of each an Ounce and a half, or two Ounces. <hi>Aquae Vita Matthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oli,</hi> from three to ſix Drams. Eſſence of <hi>Caſtor</hi> a Dram and a half. Spirit of <hi>Sal armoniac,</hi> or inſtead of it Spirit
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:207638:17"/>of <hi>Hartſhorn</hi> with Amber, from half a Dram to a Dram, Syrup of Fumitory from half an Ounce to ſix Drams. Mix all together and give a ſpoonful often.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes we add fifteen or twenty four Grains of Red <hi>Coral</hi> and <hi>Crabs Eyes,</hi> or three or ſix drops of the diſtill'd Oyl of <hi>Cloves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An <hi>Alcalin</hi> Depravation muſt be cur'd by <hi>Acids.</hi> The vegetable <hi>Acids</hi> are <hi>Vinegar,</hi> Juice of <hi>Citrons, Berberis, Quenches,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Acid</hi> Spirits are commonly extracted from Minerals, as the Spirit of <hi>Salt, Vitriol</hi> and <hi>Nitre;</hi> which laſt, if dulcify'd with Spirit of Wine, is of excellent uſe in a redundancy of <hi>Choler.</hi> It allays the <hi>Saline</hi> ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and fixes that Volatil mobility which occaſions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural Commotions. Mineral and Metalline Sulphurs mix'd with <hi>Nitre,</hi> are very proper on the ſame occaſion. Such as are <hi>Antimony Diaphoretic,</hi> and <hi>Bezoar</hi> Mineral, which qualifie the ſharp, and curb the inflammable Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; They are likewiſe Pacific, and Evacuate the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles thus fix'd and corrected by the pores of the skin.</p>
                  <p>Neither are the Compoſing Medicines, that partake of <hi>Opium,</hi> to be neglected in this caſe. 'Tis true, their cure is but Palliative; but the ſervice they do in Compoſing the Spirits, and Quelling all irregular motions, do ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently juſtify their uſe.</p>
                  <p>All <hi>Acid</hi> remedies augment the quantity of <hi>Acids</hi> in the Body. The Aromatic and Spirituous Liquors, the Volatil Salts as well ſharp as Oyly, and the bitter Ingredients which we generally exhibit in Intermitting Feavers, are all effectual reſtorers of the Volatil Oyly Salt in the blood, and conſequently of the Choler which it produces.</p>
                  <p>If a ſharp <hi>Volatil</hi> and <hi>Choleric Salt</hi> Reign in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it commonly produces <hi>Thirſt, Choleric Looſeneſſes,</hi> and ſuch like ſymptoms that attend burning Feavers. The following preſcriptions are uſual in that caſe.</p>
                  <p>Take of <hi>Tartar</hi> Vitriolated one Dram, the <hi>Salt</hi> call'd <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canum Duplicatum</hi> half a Dram, or two Scruples, <hi>Bezoar Mineral</hi> one Scruple. Make a Powder for three Doſes. Or,</p>
                  <p>Take of <hi>Nitre</hi> Prepar'd with <hi>Antimony,</hi> or <hi>Arcanum Duplicatum</hi> half a Dram, <hi>Bezoar Mineral</hi> one Scruple. Mix them for two Doſes. Or,</p>
                  <p>Take of <hi>Nitre</hi> Prepar'd with <hi>Antimony</hi> half a Dram, <hi>Arcanum Duplicatum,</hi> Fifteen Crains, or one Scruple. Mix for a Powder.</p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:207638:17"/>
                  <p>Take Powder of <hi>Ivory</hi> and <hi>Liverwort,</hi> of each half a Dram. Mix them for two Doſes.</p>
                  <p>Take Powder of <hi>Liverwort</hi> two Scruples, <hi>Crabs Eyes</hi> Prepar'd one Scruple. Make a Powder to be divided into three Parts.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Preſcriptions are very uſeful, before Evacuation, where an Oyly Volatil Salt prevails.</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Sorrel</hi> and <hi>Rasberry Water</hi> of each an Ounce and a half, freſh Juice of <hi>Citrons</hi> or <hi>Quinces</hi> one Ounce. <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoretic Antimony</hi> from one Scruple to one Dram. <hi>Bezoar Mineral</hi> from half a Scruple to a whole one. Syrup of <hi>Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries,</hi> ſix Drams or one Ounce. With a convenient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the Spirit of <hi>Nitre</hi> dulcified, make a <hi>Julep.</hi> Doſe two ſpoonfuls.</p>
                  <p>Take of <hi>Rasberry Water</hi> three Ounces. Juice of <hi>Rasber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> three Drams, <hi>Diaphoretic Antimony</hi> one Dram. Syrup of <hi>Rasberries</hi> half an Ounce. With the Spirit of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> as much as ſufficeth for a grateful ſharpneſs; Make a Julep.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have hinted at the general Cures of <hi>Alcaline</hi> and <hi>Acid</hi> Corruptions. Beſides theſe already mention'd, there are ſome Univerſal Remedies not confin'd to either ſide, but uſeful in both Caſes. Theſe are Emulſions extracted from the Milky Seeds, the diſtill'd Oyls of Vegetables, <hi>Gums, Mucilages,</hi> and the Sulphurous Productions of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals; which are all of a temperate Nature, and equally remov'd from either extreme.</p>
                  <p>A Pituitous <hi>Cacechymy</hi> muſt be cur'd by Altering, Atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating and Reſolving remedies, Namely <hi>Alcali Salts,</hi> as well fix'd as <hi>Volatil,</hi> the more penetrating Gums, and Generous <hi>Aromatics.</hi> The Morbific matter being viſcid and tough, muſt be prepar'd and digeſted before we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any Evacuation. The common forms for Digeſtives are as follows.</p>
                  <p>Take of <hi>Tartar</hi> Vitriolated, and the Salt call'd <hi>Digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum Hypochondriacum</hi> of each fifteen Grains, Salt of <hi>Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> and of <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> of each half a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Mix for a Powder to be divided into two parts. Or,</p>
                  <p>Take of <hi>Tartar</hi> Vitriolated one Dram, Salt of <hi>Cardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Benedictus</hi> half a Dram, flowers of <hi>Sal armoniac</hi> fifteen Grains. Mix them together, and divide the Powder into three Doſes. Or,</p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:207638:18"/>
                  <p>Take of <hi>Tartar</hi> Vitriolated half a Dram, <hi>Crabs Eyes</hi> prepar'd one Scruple, Salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> half a Scruple. Mix them for two Doſes.</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Tartar</hi> Vitriolated half a Dram, Salt of <hi>Wormwood, Crabs Eyes</hi> prepar'd, of each fourteen Grains. Make a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be divided into three or four Doſes.</p>
                  <p>Take of the Cream of <hi>Tartar</hi> one Dram, <hi>Tartar</hi> Vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated half a Dram, Salt of <hi>Wormwood</hi> and <hi>Cichory</hi> of each half a Scruple. Make a Powder and divide it into three equal parts. Theſe Powders muſt be exhibited a Day or two before Evacuation.</p>
                  <p>The following Powder is to be taken twice a Day, in the Morning before Dinner, and in the Afternoon two or three hours before Supper.</p>
                  <p>Take of <hi>Sal armoniac</hi> depurated a Dram and a half, <hi>Maſtic</hi> half a Dram, <hi>Cinnamom</hi> a Scruple, Salt of <hi>Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> ſix Grains. Mix them, and uſe as before di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</p>
                  <p>If Liquid forms are more acceptable, they may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd thus,</p>
                  <p>Take of <hi>Mint Water</hi> one Ounce, the Salt call'd <hi>Arcanum Duplicatum</hi> one Scruple, <hi>Crabs Eyes</hi> prepar'd half a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> five Grains. Syrup of <hi>Hyſſop</hi> half an Ounce. Mix them for a draught. Or thus,</p>
                  <p>Take of <hi>Mint Water</hi> two Ounces, <hi>Cinnamom Water</hi> ſix Drams, <hi>Gum Ammoniac</hi> diſſolv'd in <hi>Vinegar</hi> one Dram, <hi>Tartar</hi> Vitriolated one Scruple, Syrup of Roſes one Ounce. Mix them for two or three Doſes.</p>
                  <p>A Serous <hi>Cacochymy</hi> is remov'd by the uſe of ſuch remedies as alter the vicious <hi>ſerum,</hi> and evacuate it. Theſe laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd are the ſubject of the enſuing Paragraph.</p>

                  <p>AFter the uſe of altering Medicines, 'tis a proper ſeaſon to exhibit thoſe that evacuate the prepar'd humors. They are diſtributed into five Claſſes. The firſt contains thoſe which operate by Vomiting. The Second, thoſe which move the Belly, and perform their office by ſtool. Thoſe of the Third paſs by Urine. The Fourth by the Pores of the Skin. And Laſtly, the Fifth is allotted to the Medicines which evacuate by Salivation. This laſt Claſs I have taken notice of elſewhere; but the other four I ſhall briefly run over.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="chapter">
                     <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of Vomiting Medicines.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE Animal Family affords no Vomits that I know of, except the Pairings of the Nails of Human Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Which we infuſe in generous Wine over Night, and in the Morning give the ſtrain'd Liquor to Drink. 'Tis an excellent Vomit.</p>
                     <p>Among the Vegetables, <hi>Aſarabacca</hi> is the ſafeſt and moſt ſucceſsful Vomit. <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> and the Ancients were not Ignorant of its efficacy. It Enjoys a ſharp pungent ſalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling that of Ginger and Zedoary; which provokes U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, Corrects the cauſes of Chronical diſtempers, and irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates the Fibres of the Stomach. I have known Inveterat <hi>Tertian</hi> and <hi>Quartan</hi> feavers, cur'd by the uſe of <hi>Aſarabec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>
                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:207638:19"/>with white Pepper, that would not yield to any other Medicines.</p>
                     <p>It may be given by way of <hi>Powder, Infuſion,</hi> or <hi>Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> If it be exhibited in form of a <hi>Powder,</hi> it ought to be Pounded very fine; for the groſſer Particles cannot enter into the Pleats of the Stomach; and being eluded there, procure to themſelves a Paſſage by Stool. Its Doſe is from half a Dram to a whole Dram.</p>
                     <p>For a gentle <hi>Infuſion</hi> we take Nine or Ten Green Leaves of <hi>Aſarabecca,</hi> and chop 'em ſmall, and infuſe them for the ſpace of a Night in four Ounces of <hi>Carduns Benedictus</hi> Water, and half an Ounce of Mead. In the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing let the ſtrain'd Liquor be exhibited. 'Tis a gentle Vomit.</p>
                     <p>For a ſtronger Infuſion, take Nine Green Leaves of <hi>Aſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabecca,</hi> Beat them in a Marble or Stone-Mortar, pouring ſimple Mead upon 'em, till ye have reduc'd them to a Juice. Then take this juice, and dilute it with two Ounces of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duus Benedictus</hi> Water. 'Tis an Admirable Vomit.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Decoction; Helmont, Zwelfer,</hi> and the Honourable Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> have obſerv'd, that if ye boyl <hi>Aſarabecca</hi> Roots in Water, they loſe their Vomiting quality, and become Diuretic; whereas if ye boyl them in Wine, 'tis an excellent Emetic. The Reaſon of which I take to be this, <hi>Viz.</hi> That their diuretic vertue proceeds from an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential ſalt not very Volatil; the ſaline Volatil Emetic parts being evaporated in boyling with Water: but Wine pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates into the Texture of its body, before theſe Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til ſalts are gone, and ſo partakes of their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
                     <p>If ye boyl <hi>Aſarabecca</hi> Roots in Mead, ye have a Noble Pectoral Medicine. It Attenuates the ſlimy humors in the Breaſt, and has no Emetic force.</p>
                     <p>There are no other Vegetable Vomits, fit to be us'd. White <hi>Hellebor,</hi> 'tis true, was frequently exhibited by the Ancients. But they infus'd it in a ſweet Wine which qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd its ſharpneſs; and beſides, the difference of Climats alters the Vertues of Medicines. I have ſeen very Tragical effects produc'd by white Hellebor, and therefore would not adviſe any to uſe it, except in one caſe, Namely Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. 'Tis a ſpecific for that diſeaſe, and is frequently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſucceſs, where Antimonial Vomits have prov'd ineffectual. Let it be us'd thus,</p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:207638:19"/>
                     <p>Take of the Roots of White Hellebor one Dram, infuſe it in Rheniſh Wine, or rather macerate it in ſome hot place for the ſpace of one Night. Then boyl it; ſtrain off this Wine and throw it away, for 'tis too ſharp. And pour freſh Wine upon it, only to ſtand in infuſion all Night. In the Morning exhibit a Dram and a half, or two Drams of the ſtrain'd Liquor to the Mad Perſon: 'Tis a Medicine admirably fit for this caſe, and this only.</p>
                     <p>In the Mineral Family, Antimony and Vitriol are the two noted Emetics. But Vitriol is not ſo Friendly to Nature as the former; it weakens the Body, and diſorders the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, whereas Antimony produces no ſuch effects. The <hi>Vitrum Antimonii</hi> alone is of more uſe and efficacy than a Thouſand others. In this Preparation, the Antimony is ſtrip'd of its External Acid Sulphur. And contains only ſome Vitriolic Particles which cauſe an Evacuation by provoking the Fibres of the Stomach to a Contraction; and an Internal fix'd Sulphur, which Compoſes the Irregular motions of the Spirits, and Corroborates Nature. Upon this Account it may juſtly claim the Privilege of being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to all other Preparations, which rather cauſe than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move diſorders.</p>
                     <p>It muſt be exhibited in infuſion with Rheniſh Wine, or in the form of a Syrup. In ſubſtance 'tis both fallacious and hurtful. In adjuſting the Doſes of the Infuſion, we muſt have a particular regard to the quantity of the Wine, and not to the Powder infus'd. For twenty Grains infus'd in three Ounces of Wine, are no ſtronger than the infuſion of five Grains in the like quantity. Rheniſh Wine is the beſt for infuſing it in, by reaſon of its Acidity, and the eaſy Admiſſion it vouchſafes to the Antimonial Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
                     <p>The ſame remarks are to be obſerv'd in the uſe of <hi>Crocus Metallorum,</hi> and <hi>Mercurius Vitae.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <div type="example">
                        <head>As for Example.</head>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Vitrum</hi> of Antimony, or <hi>Crocus Metallorum,</hi> or <hi>Mercurius Vitae,</hi> four, five, ſix, or eight Grains: infuſe them in a ſufficient quantity of Rheniſh Wine. Let them ſtand in a warm place all Night. In the Morning ſtrain the Wine through a Paper, and exhibit one Ounce, or at moſt an Ounce and a half, for a draught. If ye pleaſe, ye may add two Drams of Cinnamom Water.</p>

                        <p>'Tis a pretty enough Contrivance that ſome have of an Antimonial Cup, into which they pour the Wine, and let it ſtand in ſome warm place for the ſpace of a Day. Then ſtrain it off, and exhibit as above.</p>
                        <p>If a Syrup be more agreeable,</p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Crocus Metallorum</hi> two Drams and two Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Infuſe it for three Days in ten Drams of Wine Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. Let it ſtand in ſome hot place, and ſhake the Veſſel frequently. Then ſtrain it off and add ten Drams of Loaf Sugar. Stop the Glaſs well, and clap it into hot Water, and the Sugar will diſſolve. Some add a Dram of the Eſſence of Red Poppy Flowers. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take four or five Drams of <hi>Vitrum Antimonii,</hi> infuſe it in pure Wine Vinegar. Let them ſtand in digeſtion for ſome Days, and ſhake the Veſſel now and then.

                        <p>Take Glaſs of Antimony in Powder half an Ounce, or an Ounce. Infuſe it in half a Pound, or a Pound of juice of Citrons, that has ſtood till it grew in ſome meaſure clear: Set them in a warm place for digeſtion, and ſhake the Glaſs frequently. Strain the Liquor, and with a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent quantity of Sugar boyl it into a Syrup; which may be preſcrib'd thus.</p>
                        <p>Take of Mint Water ſix Drams, or an Ounce; Cinnamom Water two Drams; This <hi>Emetic Syrup</hi> half an Ounce; Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of Tobacco two Drams. Mix for a Draught. The Doſe of the Emetic Syrup muſt be vary'd according to its Preparation.</p>
                        <p>Some exhibit theſe Antimonial Emetics in the form of a Conſerve or Bolus. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Vitrum Antimonii</hi> in Powder one Ounce; infuſe it in a Pint of New Wine or Juice of Quinces. Let 'em ſtand for digeſtion for ſome Days, then ſtrain it nicely through a Linnen Cloth or Paper; and ſet the ſtrained Liquor over a gentle fire, to evaporate to the conſiſtence of Honey, or a ſoft Conſerve. Ye may give about the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Peaſe or two.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are the ſafeſt and moſt uſual Vomits; next to them is Emetic Tartar, which is an Antimonial Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but may ſafely be given in Powder. 'Tis true, the general Maxim is, that all Antimonial Vomits ought to be given in infuſion; but ſolid Emetic Tartar is in a manner
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:207638:20"/>the ſame with the infuſion of Antimony in Wine. For Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar being the Natural Production of Wine, is impregnated with the ſame Acid, that equally rejects the Groſſer and Noxious Parts of the Antimony, as well in a ſolid as a liquid form.</p>
                        <p>The beſt Preparation of Emetic Tartar is made from <hi>Vitrum Antimonii,</hi> thus,</p>
                        <p>Take Glaſs of Antimony two Ounces, beat it up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with an equal quantity of Cream of Tartar, boyl them in a ſufficient quantity of Common Water, and ſtrain the liquor while 'tis hot; then expoſe it to the Cold Air, and 'twill run into Cryſtals. Thus ye have Emetic Tartar both in a liquid and ſolid form. The common Doſe is two or three Grains, or five to robuſter Perſons. In Madneſs and Melancholly diſtempers we are oblig'd to augment the Doſe. The common form of Preſcription is, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
                        <p>Take of Emetic Tartar two, three, four or five Grains, Sugar refin'd ſix or ten Grains. Mix and make a Powder. Ye may add two drops of diſtill'd Oyl of Mint. Or, if ye deſire it ſhould move the Belly, two or three Grains of Scammony prepar'd with Sulphur, thus,</p>
                        <p>Take two Grains of Emetic Tartar, two or three Grains of <hi>Scammony</hi> prepar'd with Sulphur, and four or five Grains of white Sugar. Mix and make a Powder. Which may be taken in a ſpoonful or two of Chicken Broth. The Sugar is added to give the Medicine a Body, leſt ſo ſmall a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity as two or three Grains ſhould be loſt, or eſcape the view of the Patient.</p>
                        <p>If a Bolus be more Acceptable.</p>
                        <p>Take Conſerve of Mint one Dram, Emetic Tartar two Grains, with a ſmall quantity of Syrup of Cinnamom, make a Bolus. Or, take <hi>Rob</hi> of Juniper half a Dram, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metic Tartar two Grains, Scammony prepar'd with Sulphur one Grain. With a ſufficient quantity of the Syrup of Orange Peel, make a Bolus. The Sulphur of Antimony call'd <hi>Auratum,</hi> is likewiſe an Excellent Vomit, if it be well prepar'd; as thus,</p>
                        <p>Take of Antimony, Tartar and Nitre, of each equal quantities. Melt the Antimony in a Crucible, then throw the Tartar and Nitre into it. Let the Sulphureous and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial parts be ſeparated by <hi>Detonation;</hi> and afterwards ſeparate the Regular or refined part from the Droſs. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Droſs in Common Water, and precipitate the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:207638:21"/>Sulphur with a ſolution of Tartar. The Precipitation is beſt perform'd by Tartar, by reaſon that it Mitigates the Acidity. The Doſe of this Sulphur is from five to ſix Grains. As,</p>
                        <p>Take Cream of Tartar half a Scruple. Sulphur of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony right prepar'd ſix Grains, prepar'd Scammony two Grains, mix and make a Powder.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are the ſafeſt and mildeſt Vomits, which may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for a Thouſand Caſes. But ſometimes when we meet with obſtinat and inveterat diſtempers, we have recourſe to Mercurial Emer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>Pure Mercury is a Metallin Alcali, which is eaſily fix'd by the addition of Acids, and ſet at liberty by Alkali's. But all Acids are not equally capable to fix it. The Spirits of Nitre and Vitriol render it very fix'd, whereas Spirit of Salt leaves it more Volatil. Thus Mercury prepar'd with the former is not ſo readily ſublimated, as when joyn'd with the latter. If ye diſſolve Quickſilver in Spirit of Nitre, the Acid of the Spirit fixes the Mercurial Alcali, ſo that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains at the bottom when ye draw off the Spirit. But if ye throw common ſalt into it, the Mercury precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, which by ſeparation and ſublimation yields a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Corroſive. But after all, 'tis certain that liquid Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cannot be Coagulated, but by Acids. For Alcali's and Urinous ſalts reſtore it to its Natural freedom. Cinnabar is a mixture of Mercury with an Acid Sulphur that fixes it; Now if ye add ſalt of Tartar, Urine, or the like, it diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages the Mercury, and brings it to life again.</p>
                        <p>The Common Mercury of the Shops is not this Genuin Alcali that I've thus deſcrib'd, but Adulterated with Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur. It being liquid, is apt to mix with an Acid, ſo that we never find it pure: This Acid Sulphur is the hidden cauſe of Salivation, it attenuates and diſſolves the viſcid ſtubborn humors, and evacuates them by the Saliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Glandules; While the Mercurial Alcali abſorbs the moſt fix'd Acids in the Body, that wou'd not yield to any other Medicine.</p>
                        <p>Crude Mercury is a mild enough Medicine, at leaſt its ſharpneſs is ſo inſenſible, that it ſeldom procures either Stool or Salivation at firſt. I preſcrib'd Crude Mercury to a Woman ſubject to the Iliac Paſſions, that had been conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated for a long time. I order'd her three Ounces to be drunk with her other liquors, and continu'd the uſe of it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ill ſhe had four and twenty Ounces in her Body. It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:207638:21"/>no ſenſible effect till the fourth Day that ſhe began to ſpit; and the viſcid humors that the Mercury had atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated were Copiouſly voided by ſtool. Thus Crude Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is inoffenſive with regard to the ſolid parts. It does not ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate either the Stomach or Guts, to contract themſelves and caſt out what they contain. But only attenuates the viſcid humors that block up the Paſſages, and prepares 'em for a ſpontaneous Evacuation.</p>
                        <p>To return to Mercurial Vomits; Mercury being of it ſelf uncapable to provoke the Stomach, muſt be mix'd with an Acid in order to become Emetic. The more it partakes of the Acid, the more fiercely it operates. If the Acid Spirit in which 'tis diſſolv'd be drawn off with a gentle fire, and but once; 'tis a dangerous Medicine and ſcarce fit to be us'd. But if the Acid be ſufficiently taken off either by a greater force of fire, or reiterated Deſtillations, it becomes milder. The mixture of the Acid and the Mercurial Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cali make a Vitriol-like Concrete, which provokes Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and moves the Belly; for all Cathartic Medicines taſte like Vitriol.</p>
                        <p>The beſt Emeric of all the Mercurial Family is <hi>Turbith</hi> Mineral. There are two ways of preparing it. The firſt was invented by <hi>Crollius,</hi> and 'tis this.</p>
                        <p>Take half a Pound of Mercury and Infuſe it in a Pound of Rectify'd Spirit of Sulphur. Draw off the Spirit with a ſtrong fire; and repeat the Deſtillation thrice. The fourth time add a little freſh Spirit, and continue to draw it off till the bottom of the Retort and the Sand become Red hot. Then take out the white Maſs, or <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> and infuſe it in Rain Water, or ſome Diſtill'd Water. Let it ſtand and digeſt till it ſweeten, that is, till all the ſharpneſs of the Water be gone. Thus the white precipitat becomes yellow. Put this yellow precipitat into a Glaſs with a long Neck, and let it ſtand for digeſtion over a fire of Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es for eight Days, that ſo the reſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ue of the Mercury (if any there be) that is not fix'd by the Acid, may be ſublimated in the Head of the Glaſs. Then take the Powder that lies at the bottom, and kindle freſh Spirit of Wine thrice upon it.</p>
                        <p>Here the Spirit of Sulphur is prefer'd to that of Vitriol, which generally retains ſome of its Mineral Particles, and by Vertue of their motions, if it ſtand any conſiderable ſpace of time, grows muddy and hot. Spirit of Salt and Nitre are two extremes, from which that of Sulphur ſeems
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:207638:22"/>to be equally remov'd. Therefore <hi>Crollius</hi> prefer'd it to all other Acids. He choſe Diſtill'd Waters for ſweetening the Precipitate, becauſe Common Water is already Loaden with Salt, and therefore unfit to charge it ſelf with Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Salts. This Turbith Mineral ought not to be given in Powder, leſt it offend the Gums and Palate; Bolus's and Pills are Convenient forms.</p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Crollius</hi>'s Turbith Mineral five Grains, <hi>Venice</hi> Triacle, as much as ſufficeth to make a Bolus. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take the ſame quantity of Turbith Mineral, and with Juice of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Liquorice reduce it to the conſiſtence of Pills.</p>
                        <p>The other preparation of Turbith Mineral, was firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the World by <hi>Mynſichtius.</hi> 'Tis as follows,</p>
                        <p>Take Corroſive Sublimat Mercury and diſſolve it in Common Water, then precipitate with the Oyl of Tartar <hi>per deliquium.</hi> Take this precipitat and ſweeten it often with a Diſtill'd Water, or not Common Water, and kindle Spirit of Wine upon it ſeveral times.</p>
                        <p>The Doſe is from five Grains to ſix. It is a very Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Medicine in all inveterat Diſtempers ariſing from an Acid. It abſorbs the Acid Particles, attenuates and evacuates the viſcid humors.</p>
                        <p>Salt of Vitriol is a Nauſeous Medicine, and hurtful to the Stomac. Its Emetic Vertue ſeems to proceed from the oar of Copper of which it partakes. The Spirit of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, and Chalybeat Minerals which are its other Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, are known to be no Vomits.</p>
                        <p>Vomiting ought to be avoided by thoſe who are Subject to a Rupture; by Child-bearing Women, and ſuch as are troubl'd with a down-falling of the Womb.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of Purging Medicines.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE Humors evacuated by ſtool are Convey'd to the Guts, by the Paſſage of the Choler, or that of the Pancreatic Juice, or through the miliar Glandules inſerted into the Coats of the Guts. The Meſaraic Veins cannot caſt forth any ſerum, by reaſon that all ſecretion muſt needs be perform'd by Glandules.</p>
                     <p>Our Purging Medicines are all prejudicial to the Stomac, except <hi>Aloe</hi> and <hi>Rhubarb.</hi> They are endow'd with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Virulency that offends our Conſtitutions; and do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually aſſault both the Noxious and Nouriſhing Juices. If they do not meet with Corrupt Humors, they make a prey of the good ones. Accordingly we ſee that they weaken the Body, diſorder the Spirits, and ſometimes produce ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſmal effects. Which obliges us to add Correcters to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify and cicurate their Malignant Qualities.</p>
                     <p>The Animal Family produces no Purgatives. The Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable Boaſts of a great many, which are all endow'd with a ſharp Volatil Salt mix'd with a viſcid Oyl. Fix'd Salts are the moſt proper Correcters of Vegetable Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, by reaſon that they open the reſinous Textures, and remove the offending viſcidity. Sometimes Fermentation produces the ſame effect. The Mineral Purging Medicines conſiſt of a ſharp Vitriolic Sulphur, which is admirably Corrected by adding Nitre.</p>
                     <p>They all compaſs their end by twitching and vellicating the Coats of the Guts, or the Orifices of the Choleric and Pancreatic Paſſages; or by ſqueezing the Miliar Glandules, and ſo provoking them to an evacuation. Some Purging Medicines enter into the Blood, and diſſolve its Maſs. If there be any corrupt juices Incorporated with it, they carry them off. If there be none, they melt down the laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Blood into ſerum, and diſpoſe it for ſecretion.</p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:207638:23"/>
                     <p>We are oppreſs'd with a Numberleſs train of Purging Medicines, whereas one or two might Anſwer all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Some few indeed, beſides the evacuating Vertue, have a ſpecific Relation to ſome Diſeaſes, as black Hellebor to Melancholly, Rhubarb to the diſorders of the Kidneys, and eſpecially <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>loquintida</hi> to all Acid Enormities. But by a modeſt Computation, five or ſix might be pick'd out that might very well ſuffice for all the Indications in Phyſic. Theſe are, Jalap, Senna, black Hellebor, Aloe and Rhubarb, to which ye may add Scammony and Coloquintida, for quickning Ingredients.</p>
                     <p>Jalap is a Root imported from <hi>Mexico.</hi> Its Purgative Vertue is owing to its reſinous Oyly parts which are ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſix'd by an Acid. For if ye extract the Reſin out of it by Spirit of Wine, the remaining <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> is rob'd of its Purging Vertue. This diſcovers the error of many Phyſicians who order Jalap to be infus'd in Wine or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Water, which are improper Vehicles for a reſinous Body. It purges gently without throws or gripings. The excrements it evacuates are ting'd with a yellow Colour. It agrees beſt with moiſt Conſtitutions; and is recommended by <hi>Borellus,</hi> as a ſpecific in a Dropſy.</p>
                     <p>If it be well Concocted in the firſt Paſſages, it not only evacuates but attenuates the humors. But the Reſin of Jalap taken in ſolid Powder ſticks to the pleats of the Stomach and Guts, cauſes a great many diſorders, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a ſuper-purgation. Whereas if it be diſſolv'd with the Yelk of an Egg in any convenient liquor, it is eaſily concoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and operates without any trouble. If Jalap be deſir'd in a ſolid form, we preſcribe thus,</p>
                     <p>Take Cream of Tartar from fifteen Grains to a Scruple, Powder of Jalap ten, twelve, or fifteen Grains, and a drop or two of Diſtill'd Oyl of Anniſſeeds or Mace. Mix and make a Powder.</p>
                     <p>If it want to be quicken'd, thus,</p>
                     <p>Take Powder of Jalap ten, fifteen or ſixteen Grains, Cream of Tartar, or Tartar Vitriolated, or the Salt call'd <hi>Arcanum Duplicatum,</hi> from twelve to fifteen Grains. Prepar'd Scammony one Grain or two. Diſtill'd Oyl of Aniſſeeds or Mace, or Cinnamon two drops. Mix and make a Powder as above. This is call'd the Purging Vegetable for many uſes, or <hi>Purgans Vegetabile Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chreſtum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:207638:23"/>
                     <p>The following preſcription purges gently and do's not Gripe.</p>
                     <p>Take Powder of Jalap from half a Scruple to fifteen Grains, Nitre depurated half a Scruple (or four Grains of Nitre and the like quantity of Salt of Tartar) prepar'd Scammony one Grain or two, Diſtill'd Oyl of Aniſſeeds or Mace one or two drops. Mix and make a Powder. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take Cream of Tartar one Scruple, Reſin of Jalap half a Scruple, Salt of Tartar ſeven Grains, Diſtill'd Oyl of Aniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeds two drops.</p>
                     <p>If a Bolus be more acceptable than a Powder,</p>
                     <p>Take of Conſerve of Clovegilliflowers half a Dram, Cream of Tartar fifteen Grains, Powder of Jalap half a Scruple. Diſtill'd Oyl of Mace two drops. With a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient quantity of Solutive Syrup of Roſes make a Bolus. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Pulp of Raiſins two Drams, Powder of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lap one Scruple, Scammony prepar'd with Sulphur one Grain. With a ſufficient quantity of the Syrup of Fumito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry make an Electuary.</p>
                     <p>For Pills preſcribe thus,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Extractum Catholicum</hi> twelve Grains. Reſin of Jalap four Grains, the extract of <hi>Trochiſci Alhandal</hi> two Grains. Mix for Pills.</p>
                     <p>For a liquid form, thus,</p>
                     <p>Take of Spirit of Wine, or of any other rectified Spirit one Pint, of the Roots of Jalap four Ounces, Citron Peel ſix Drams; Saffron five Grains. Let them ſtand in a warm infuſion, then ſtrain the liquor and reſerve it for uſe: 'Tis call'd <hi>Eſſentia Citrata,</hi> and may be given from half an Ounce to ſix Drams. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of Hyſſop Water one Ounce, Cinnamon Water three Drams. Powder of Jalap fifteen Grains. Extract of <hi>Trochiſci Alhandal</hi> two Grains. Syrup of Cichory with Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb half an Ounce. Mix for a Potion. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take Roſin of Jalap from half a Scruple to twelve Grains, Salt of Tartar from ſix to ſeven Grains, with a ſufficient quantity of the Syrup of Roſes, make a Syrup. The Salt of Tartar Correct the reſin, and prevents its ſticking to the pleats of the Stomach.</p>
                     <p>If an Emulſion be more agreeable,</p>
                     <p>Take Melonſeeds peel'd half a Dram, Reſin of Jalap ſix, ſeven, eight, nine, or fourteen Grains. Beat them up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:207638:24"/>pouring in of warm Roſe Water or Mint Water, or any other convenient Water, one Ounce; add Cinnamon Water two Drams. Make an Emulſion, and ſweeten it with ſolutive Syrup of Roſes or any other grateful Syrup. Ye may add two Grains of Scammony prepar'd with Sulphur or one Grain of the extract of <hi>Trochiſci Alhandal,</hi> with eight Grains of Salt of Tartar.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hartwigius</hi> prepar'd it with the Yelk of an Egg, thus,</p>
                     <p>Take Reſin of Jalap ſeven, eight, or ten Grains (and for thoſe who are more robuſt, twelve or fifteen Grains) beat 'em up with the Yelk of an Egg. Then pour upon them of Fennel or Mint Water half an Ounce, or as much as ſufficeth to make an Emulſion. Afterwards add Cinnamon Water a Dram or two; with a ſmall quantity of ſugar or Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of Cinnamom. 'Tis an admirable Purge and ſometimes evacuates both upwards and downwards.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Senna</hi> was firſt found out by the <hi>Arabians. Hippocrates,</hi> and the Ancient <hi>Grecians</hi> knew nothing of it. It is a mild Purgative; more uſual in Chronical Diſtempers, than in acute, which are generally cur'd by Vomits. Three things are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to be obſerv'd in uſing of it. Firſt, that the leaves be well ſeparated from the ſtalks, which are apt to Gripe. Secondly, that they be not infus'd too long, leſt the thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker mucilage which is troubleſom to the Stomac and Guts be alſo extracted. For the Purging Vertue of <hi>Senna</hi> proceeds from a Volatil mucilage attended by a thicker. The former is gentle and eaſy. The latter griping to a high degree. Thirdly, that it be never exhibited without the addition of Ginger and Tartar, which ſharpen and atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate the mucilage. It is a proper purge for hot and dry Conſtitutions.</p>
                     <p>We preſcribe it in Powder thus,</p>
                     <p>Take of Cream of Tartar and Leaves of Pick'd <hi>Senna,</hi> of each two Drams, Ginger, Aniſſeeds, Cinnamom and Galandal, of each half a Scruple. Mix and make a Powder. Which is a gentle Lenitive, and may be taken at Dinner in a ſpoonful of broth. Doſe; as much as will lie upon the Point of a knife. The infuſion of <hi>Senna</hi> is better than the Decoction, in which the Volatil mucilage evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and the thicker is too much extracted. If ye add Cream of Tartar to it, it muſt always be boyl'd, elſe it will not mix with the Cream. Therefore in ſimple infuſions we
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:207638:24"/>only add Salt of Tartar, and for the moſt part black Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebor.</p>
                     <p>For Decoction,</p>
                     <p>Take of the leaves of Pick'd <hi>Senna,</hi> Fearn of the Oak, of each three Drams, Cream of Tartar one Dram. Boyl them in a cloſe Veſſel with a ſufficient quantity of Cinnamom Water. Strain out three Ounces of the Liquor, and add to it three Drams of Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mom Water, and half an Ounce of the Syrup of Borrage. Mix for a draught.</p>
                     <p>For Infuſion,</p>
                     <p>Take of the leaves of <hi>Senna</hi> two, three, or four Drams. Ginger or Aniſſeeds a Scruple, Salt of Tartar from fifteen Grains to a Scruple. Infuſe them in a ſufficient quantity of Cinnamom Water, or Fumitory, or Cichory Water. Let them ſtand warm for a Night. In the morning give two or four Ounces of the ſtrain'd Liquor according to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the Patient, adding two, three, or four Drams of ſolutive Syrup of Roſes, or Syrup of the Juice of Chermes Berries. The Salt of Tartar will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Potion red, but 'tis very grateful, and operates gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But I prefer the following infuſion.</p>
                     <p>Take of the leaves of <hi>Senna</hi> a Dram and a half, or two or four Drams (at moſt.) Black Hellebor Roots, from half a Dram to a Dram, (or Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb from a Dram to two Drams) Anniſſeeds, from a Scruple to a Dram (or Ginger from a Scruple to half a Dram) Salt of Tartar fifteen, twenty, or thirty Grains. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe them in a ſufficient quantity of Betony, Fumitory, Hyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſop or Cichory Water, for a Night. Add to two, three or four Ounces of the ſtrain'd Liquor, three or four Drams of Cinnamom Water, with half an Ounce of ſolutive Syrup of Roſes, or Syrup of Apples, or any other ſweetening thing.</p>
                     <p>If ye deſign one Infuſion for ſeveral Doſes,</p>
                     <p>Take of Corents an Ounce and a half, beat them in a Marble Mortar, pouring upon them a pint and a half of warm Water. Then infuſe leaves of Pick'd <hi>Senna</hi> three Drams, Cream of Tartar one Dram, Violet Flowers three little handfuls. Let them infuſe warm in a Glaſs well ſtopp'd. And when 'tis grown cold give three or four Ounces every Morning and Evening, or every other Day. It is good for dry Hypochondriac Conſtitutions, and ſuch as are ſubject to a Conſtipated Belly. But it ought
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:207638:25"/>not to be kept above eight Days. In Chronical Diſeaſes, and Inveterat quartan Feavers, the following Infuſion may be given before the invaſion of the Paroxiſm.</p>
                     <p>Take of the leaves of <hi>Senna</hi> three Drams, black Hellebor Roots a Dram and a half, Ginger half a Dram, Salt of Tartar two Scruples (if ye pleaſe, ye may add ſome ſweet <hi>Calamus</hi> Roots) chop and beat them ſmall, and tye them up in a Bag. Whch infuſe in a Pint and a half of Water, or warm Ale. Set it in a warm place, and let it grow cold by degrees; Let the ſick Perſon take two or three Drams every two or three hours.</p>
                     <p>I proceed to black Hellebor. 'Tis call'd ſo from its little black Roots, tho' it have white Flowers. It is endow'd with a Volatil ſharpneſs, not unlike that of Antiſcorbutic Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines. Upon this Account it is a ſpecific for all Diſeaſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Nerves. It is never given in ſubſtance by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its extreme ſharpneſs; but only in infuſion, or by way of Extract. The Ancients were wont to infuſe it in Vinegar; but in vain. For all Acids are ſo far from Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting Vegetable Purging Medicines, that they rather Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon them and elude their Operation.</p>
                     <p>The Warry Vehicles are beſt for Hellebor, which we ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally infuſe together with <hi>Senna.</hi> Salt of Tartar is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Correcter for it. In a dry Scorbutic Conſtitution we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it in whey, thus,</p>
                     <p>Take o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> black Hellebor Roots two Drams, <hi>Senna</hi> leaves one Dram (if ye pleaſe, ye may add Polypody or Water Creſſes) Infuſe in a ſufficient quantity of Clarified whey for a Night. In the Morning ſtrain out three Ounces, and add to it a Dram of Spirit of Scurvy-Graſs and two Drams of Cinnamom Water. Mix and make a draught for one Doſe. Oft-times the Hellebor is ty'd up in a Bag.</p>
                     <p>As for the Extract, the moſt compendious way of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is this.</p>
                     <p>Take of black Hellebor Roots ſlic'd a convenient quantity; Infuſe them in Rheniſh Wine. Let them digeſt till the Wine have aſſum'd the taſte and colour of the Hellebor, Then thicken it to the conſiſtence of a Rob. Some add Salt of Tartar. Some make this Extract with Spirit of Wine, but I ſhould not dare to uſe it.</p>
                     <p>In a Habitual Epilepſy the following Pills are very proper.</p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:207638:25"/>
                     <p>Take of Extract of black Hellebor half a Scruple, or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Grains, ſweet Mercury half a Scruple, fifteen Grains, or a whole Scruple (according to the Circumſtances of the Patient.) Extract of the Troches call'd Alhandal, from one to three Grains. With a ſufficient quantity of the Eſſence of Mint, or Sage, or Saſſafras, make Pills.</p>
                     <p>For Cachectic Scorbutic Diſpoſitions uſe the following Pill.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Quercetanus</hi>'s Tartar Pills and Extract of black Hellebor, of each twelve or fifteen Grains. Prepar'd Scam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from one to three Grains. With a ſufficient quantity of the ſolution of Steel prepar'd with Salt; Make Pills for one Doſe.</p>

With a ſufficient quantity of the Eſſence of <hi>Gum Ammoniac,</hi> make Pills; Which are of excellent uſe to Hypochondriac Perſons.</p>
                     <p>Next to Hellebor comes <hi>Aloe.</hi> It is the Juice of an <hi>Indian</hi> Plant, and was frequently us'd by the Ancients. It has ſome Gummy Parts and ſome Reſinous. The former evacuate very gently. The latter are endow'd with a baumy aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent bitterneſs, and Entitle Aloe to the Character of an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Stomachic. Theſe two parts are evidently diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd by waſhing Aloe in Water; where the Gummy part is waſh'd away, and the Reſinous remains. Yet ſome People are ſo fooliſh as to preſcribe waſh'd Aloe for a Purging Medicine.</p>
                     <p>'Tis no quick Purgative, and therefore ſcarce ſo proper for Acute, as for Chronical diſtempers, where gradual and ſlow Purgations are requir'd; and where the altering Medicines muſt keep pace with thoſe which evacuate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For a Perſon ſubject to the Hypochondriac diſtemper, I've order'd the following Pills to be ſwallow'd down once in two or four weeks.</p>
                     <p>Take of lucid Aloe two Drams, <hi>Gum Ammoniac</hi> diſſolv'd in Vinegar one Dram, Tartar prepar'd with Vitriol half a Dram. With a ſufficient quantity of the Eſſence of <hi>Gum Ammoniac;</hi> Make a Maſs for Pills, of which take ten or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen two hours before ſupper, and they will purge gently next Day. <hi>N. B. Gum Ammoniac</hi> ought to be diſſolv'd, not depurated or evaporated, leſt it ſuſtain a loſs of its better part.</p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:207638:26"/>
                     <p>The Extract of Aloe may be made thus,</p>
                     <p>Take a convenient quantity of the Juice of Succory, or Roſes, or Violets; Infuſe lucid Aloe into it. Let it ſtand for Digeſtion, and 'twill Extract a mucilage; ſtrain this mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilage and thicken it to the conſiſtence of an Extract. Which may be given in Pills. Doſe; one, two, or three Grains. Or thus,</p>
                     <p>Take of Extract of Aloes thus prepar'd half an Ounce, Extract of <hi>Gum Ammoniac</hi> two Drams. The Vitriol of Steel Calcinated till it become white one Dram, Troches call'd <hi>Alhandal</hi> twelve Grains. With a ſufficient quantity of the Eſſence of Steel, make a Maſs for Pills.</p>
                     <p>Next to Aloe the moſt uſual Purging Medicine is Rhubarb. Which, if it be Genuine, is Imported hither from <hi>Sina.</hi> It enjoys a Volatil ſharpneſs lodg'd in a watry mucilage, which cauſes evacuation; but is ſo ſubtile that the leaſt heat drives it away. And when it is gone, the remainder is a fix'd, bitter, pacific ſubſtance; which is admirably fitted for removing Looſeneſſes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting the Liver, and redreſſing the diſorders of the Kidneys.</p>
                     <p>If it be given in Infuſion, preſcribe thus,</p>
                     <p>Take of the tops of leſſer Centory one handful, choice Rhubarb two or three Drams. Leaves of <hi>Senna</hi> one Dram. <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi> half a <hi>Scruple.</hi> Infuſe in a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Wormwood</hi> Wine for a Night. Strain it in the Morning and exhibit three Ounces.</p>
                     <p>For the <hi>Jaundice</hi> and other diſorders of the Liver, we commonly preſcribe a large infuſion for ſeveral Doſes. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of Corents beaten from an Ounce to an Ounce and a half, choice <hi>Rhubarb</hi> from half an Ounce to ſix Drams, <hi>Cinnamom</hi> two Drams. Infuſe in a Pound and a half of water. Let them ſtand for four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hours in a cloſe Veſſel put into hot water. 'Tis a very Pleaſant Potion for ſeveral Doſes.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo given in Powder; as for Dyſenteries, Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take choice <hi>Rhubarb</hi> and burnt <hi>Hartſhorn</hi> of each half a Dram, Extract of <hi>Venice</hi> Triacle four Grains (or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of it, a Grain and a half of <hi>Laudanum Opiatum</hi>) Diſtill'd Oyl of <hi>Cinnamom</hi> one or two drops. Mix and make a Powder.</p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:207638:26"/>
                     <p>Toaſted Rhubarb, tho' commonly us'd in this caſe, is a medicine of no efficacy. Rhubarb it ſelf in Powder is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely better. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of choice Rhubarb (not toaſted) fifteen Grains, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd Blood Stone half a Scruple. Red Coral Prepar'd five Grains. Mix and make a Powder.</p>
                     <p>The following Electuary is a Sovereign Medicine for the Yellow Jaundice.</p>
                     <p>Take of Raiſins bruis'd four Ounces, choice Rhubarb reduced to fine Powder half an Ounce, with a ſufficient quantity of ſolutive Syrup of Roſes make an Electuary. Of which, let the Patient take about the bigneſs of a Nutmeg.</p>
                     <p>Some make an Extract of Rhubarb with Spirit of Wine; but 'tis good for nothing. Some make it with Water, which is better than the former, tho' not extraordinary. Some make <hi>Elixyr Proprietatis</hi> with Rhubarb, and 'tis an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Medicine.</p>
                     <p>The Remaining Purgatives are Scammony and Colequin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida, which are ſeldom exhibited alone, but added to other Medicines. They are very uſeful, where we deſire to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge the quantity of a Purging Medicine. As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</p>
                     <p>Take of Pills of <hi>Hiera</hi> with <hi>Agaric, Quercetanus</hi>'s Pills of Ammoniac, of each half a Scruple. Prepar'd Scammc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny two Grains, <hi>Troches</hi> call'd <hi>Alhandal</hi> one Grain. With the Diſtill'd Oyl of Mace make Pills. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Maſs for Pills of <hi>Hiera</hi> with <hi>Agaric,</hi> twelve, fifteen or twenty Grains. Gum Ammoniac diſſolv'd in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar half a Scruple, Scammony Prepar'd with Sulphur two Grains, Extract of Troches <hi>Alhandal,</hi> one Grain. With a ſufficient quantity of the Eſſence of Wormwood, or Saſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fras, Make a Maſs for Pills. If ye pleaſe, ye may add half a Scruple of Extract of Wormwood. They are of Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal uſe, as likewiſe what follows.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Andernius</hi>'s <hi>Extractum Catholicum,</hi> and of Crol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius<hi>'s Extractum Panchymagogum,</hi> of each half a Scruple, Gum Ammoniac diſſolv'd in Vinegar twelve Grains, Scam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony Prepar'd with Sulphur, and Extract of Troches <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handal,</hi> of each one or two Grains. With <hi>Elixyr Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietatis,</hi> or Tincture of Tartar. Make Pills.</p>
                     <p>Scammony is us'd likewiſe in Powder. As,</p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:207638:27"/>
                     <p>Take of Tartar Prepar'd with Vitriol, twelve or fifteen Grains. Scammony Prepar'd with Sulphur, two or three Grains. Troches <hi>Alhandal</hi> (or the Extract made of 'em) one or two Grains. Oyl of Aniſeeds two drops. Mix and make a Powder.</p>
                     <p>If a Bolus be more acceptable.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Powder call'd <hi>Hypochondriacus Laxativus</hi> one Dram, Prepar'd Scammony one or two Grains. With a ſufficient quantity of ſolutive Syrup of Roſes, Make a Bolus.</p>
                     <p>Scammony is the Baſis of the Powder call'd <hi>Cornachini,</hi> which is ſometimes Lenitive and ſometimes Emetic. 'Tis this,</p>
                     <p>Take Reſin of Scammony half a Scruple. Antimony fix'd and reduc'd to an <hi>Alcali,</hi> by the Addition of Nitre, eight Grains. Cream of Tartar three Grains. Mix and make a Powder. <hi>N. B.</hi> that Antimony fix'd by Nitre is more proper than Diaphoretic Antimony.</p>
                     <p>Scammony enjoys both a Reſinous ſubſtance which eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuates, and a Gummy ſubſtance which alters and melts down the humors. 'Tis a Medicine, that may be ſafely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to Children, if mix'd with Saline Powders. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of Cream of Tartar fifteen Grains. Tartar Prepar'd with Vitriol half a Scruple. Prepar'd Scammony two Grains. Troches <hi>Alhandal</hi> one Grain. Mix and make a Powder. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Pulp of Raiſins a Dram and a half. Tartar Prepar'd with Vitriol, or <hi>Sal-armoniac,</hi> twelve Grains. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin of Jalap ſix Grains. Scammony Prepar'd with Sulphur two Grains. With ſolutive Syrup of Roſes, Make a Bolus.</p>
                     <p>Reſin of Scammony is a Medicine that I do not much admire. Scammony it ſelf in Powder and right Prepar'd is beſt. I Prepare it with Clarified Juice of Quinces, mixing them well together, and letting them ſtand for Digeſtion. This Extracts a Mucilage which I take out and thicken. It may be us'd either by way of Powder or Extract.</p>
                     <p>If an Emulſion be more Acceptable.</p>
                     <p>Take Prepar'd Scammony from half a Scruple to fifteen Grains, pour upon it Roſe-Water ſharpen'd by Oyl of Tartar, <hi>per Deliquium;</hi> and make an Emulſion according to Art. Ye may add a little Cinnamom-Water, and ſweeten it with Sugar or Syrup.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Coliquintida</hi> is a harſh Medicine, but if well Prepar'd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces many laudable effects. The beſt Preparation is with
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:207638:27"/>Salt of Tartar. If it ſtand and digeſt with Salt of Tartar for any conſiderable time, its ſharpneſs Vaniſhes, and the Bitterneſs only remains. Some uſe the Extract of it, and ſome tye it in a Bag; but I prefer the form of Troches.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall conclude the train of Purging Medicines with ſweet Mercury, or <hi>Mercurius Dulcis.</hi> 'Tis added to other Purges, in order to qualify them for Chronical Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Crollius</hi>'s Extract, call'd <hi>Panchymagogum,</hi> or of black Hellebor fifteen Grains. Sweet Mercury from half a Scruple to fifteen Grains. Scammony Prepar'd with Sulphur a Grain or two. Extract of Troches <hi>Alhandal</hi> one Grain, or a Grain and a half. With the Eſſence of Mint or Saſſaffras, make Mercurial Pills. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of Conſerve of Fumitory one Dram. Sweet Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury from fifteen Grains to a Scruple. Prepar'd Scammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny five Grains. With the Conſerve of Rasberries, Make a Bolus.</p>

                     <p>THE third ſort of evacuating Medicines is Diuretic. Some of which are Volatil, ſome fix'd. The Volatil are ſuch as theſe. Take of Parſley-Water two or three Ounces. Reſthar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, or Winter Cherry-Water one Ounce. <hi>Elixyr</hi> of Juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Berries (from ſimilitude of taſte call'd <hi>Malvaticum</hi>) ſix Drams or one Ounce, or an Ounce and a half. Spirit of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified Earthworms three-Drams. Volatil Spirit of Tartar from half an Ounce to ſix Drams. Syrup of Ground Ivy, or Syrup of Fennel, from three to ſix Drams. Mix and make a Potion. Of which exhibit a ſpoonful at a time. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of Ground Ivy-Water, Reſtharrow-Water, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſley-Water, of each an Ounce. <hi>Elixyr</hi> of Juniper (call'd <hi>Malvaticum</hi>) an Ounce and a half.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:207638:28"/>and make a Potion. Doſe, two, three, or four Spoonfuls. Or, add three or four drops of diſtill'd Oyl of Turpentin, or ſix drops of Oyl of Juniper, in the Room of Spirit of <hi>Sal-armoniac.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of Strawberry-Water two Ounces. Tincture of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar two Drams. Syrup of Ground Ivy half an Ounce. Mix and make a Potion. Ye may add Eſſential Salt of Tartar, or dulcify'd Spirit of Salt, or Quinteſſence of Urine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Amelungius</hi>'s Nephritic Tincture, is a Powerful Diuretic. 'Tis made of Nitre, Tartar, Hungarian Antimony, and a ſort of Flint Stones that are ſpeckl'd with yellow ſpots. The Nitre is firſt diſſolv'd in Simple Water, then the other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients are added, and after Digeſtion the Liquor is drawn off by Diſtillation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Michael</hi>'s Carminative Spirit is likewiſe an excellent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine for this purpoſe, which is drawn from Nitre, Tartar and Spirit of Wine Tartaris'd: But above all Amber, with its Volatil Salt and Diſtill'd Oyl.</p>
                     <p>All the Aromatic Herbs, but eſpecially fleabane, are good Diuretics. Camphyr, Turpentin, Juniper, Human Urine, Earthworms, and their various Preparations, are likewiſe of the ſame Family.</p>
                     <p>The Juice of the Birch-Tree, provokes Urine more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually than any other Medicine. It ferments like Wine, and becomes ſowr like Vinegar; and is an incomparable Medicine for Nephritic Pains.</p>
                     <p>Next to it is the Infuſion of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> flies, which I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare thus.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Powder of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> flies one Scruple, Infuſe them in three or four Ounces of the beſt Rheniſh Wine. Let them ſtand in a warm place for ſeveral Days and Nights. Then ſtrain it out through Paper. The Doſe ten, fifteen, or twenty drops to be exhibited in a draught of warm Broth. Sometimes this Medicine cauſes Ulcers in the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and a Piſſing of Blood; but a large draught of Milk with a little Salt of Tartar, will quickly remove theſe Symptoms.</p>
                     <p>For a Diuretic Decoction. Preſcribe thus,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Leaves of Strawberries and Pellitory of the Wall, of each a handful and a half. Of the five opening Roots ten Drams.

                  </head>
                  <p>THE Animal Faculty lyes under the influence of the Animal Spirits and Nerves. The Nerves are immediately nouriſh'd and ſupplyed by the Chyle; which, if it be Faulty or Acid, Communicates a noxious quality to them. Their ſtructure conſiſts of delicate fine fibres, ſome of which are diſtributed into ſmall Branches, and ſome gather'd into a Body, as the Brain, the Membranes, Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All motion depends upon the due Stretching of theſe fibres, and regular incurſions of the Animal Spirits. The Spirits are diſorder'd by any accident that either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs their ſtock, or irritates them beyond their wonted pace. This may be occaſion'd either by an External Cold, or a Vicious Acid Reigning within. The Oyly Volatil Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines are at once qualify'd to ſubdue this prevailing Acid, and Retrieve the Spirits. Such are the Herbs commonly call'd Cephalic, as Roſemary, Mint, Sage, Marjoram, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Likewiſe the Sulphurs of Metals, Spirits and Diſtill'd Oyls, eſpecially ſuch as are drawn from Amber, and the Parts of Animals. The Artificial <hi>Sal Volatile O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leoſum,</hi> is admirably conducive to the Nerves. But <hi>Sylvius,</hi> who firſt diſcover'd it, was not ſo generous as to gratify the World with the Secret. Tho' after all, 'tis no difficult mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Prepare it. The beſt is from Soot. 'Tis eaſily drawn from Amber, thus,</p>
                  <p>Take of Quick Lime and Sal-armoniac, of each equal quantities, add to them a third Part of Amber. Mix them and pour upon 'em a few drops of Tartaris'd Spirit of Wine. Diſtill thro' a Glaſs Retort in Sand. Separat the Spirit that comes over from the Oyl, and Rectify it again. 'Tis a Noble Medicine for the Indiſpoſitions of the Nerves.</p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:207638:31"/>
                  <p>Or, ye may make it with other Diſtill'd Oyls. As,</p>
                  <p>Take Cinnamom or Cloves, and pour upon 'em Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris'd Spirit of Wine. Let 'em ſtand for Digeſtion, and the Spirit of Wine becomes Red.

                  <p>If ye be oblig'd to an Extemporary Preſcription, uſe the following.</p>
                  <p>Take of Mint, Fennel and Baum Waters, of each one Ounce. Eſſence of Caſtor three Ounces. Succinated Spirit of Hartſhorn two Drams. Spirit of <hi>Sal-armoniac,</hi> one Dram. <hi>Laudanum O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatum,</hi> two or three Grains. Syrup of the rindes of Oranges, or of Cinnamom, ſix Drams. Mix and make a Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Doſe a ſpoonful at a time.</p>
                  <p>In exhibiting Sharp and Volatil Medicines, we ought to have a ſpecial regard to the delicacy of the Nerves. Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe in the Mouth of the Stomach, which lye more open and expos'd to the injuries of a fierce Medicine. Therefore we ſee that Perſons Obnoxious to Anxieties, Swooning, and ſuch like diſorders of the Spirits, complain moſt of their Breaſt or Stomac. And Women, or Children, whoſe Nerves are more delicate and fine than thoſe of Men, are apt to receive more ſenſible Impreſſions in the Stomac from an Active Medicine. Beſides, If the Stomac be offended, the other Parts will ſhare in the Injury, by reaſon of the ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy maintain'd among 'em by means of the Nerves. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one and the ſame Nerve Viſits ſeveral Parts and Cauſes a mutual conſent, as the under Lip and the Mouth of the Stomach. Sometimes when two Nerves are Contiguous, the one influences t'other, as when a Stone in the Bladder provokes the <hi>Inteſtinum Rectum.</hi> Sometimes the Parts are Connected by Nervous Ligaments, and ſo are render'd ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of one another's Circumſtances, as the Head and the Stomac, the Stomac and Kidneys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:207638:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>Theſe Nerves are the ſource of motion. They ſerve to Convey the Animal Spirits to all the Parts of the Body, in order to their Reciprocal Contraction and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation.</p>
                  <p>When the motion of any Member is irregular, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from one of theſe three Cauſes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Either the Animal Spirits are ſcanty and deficient, or Lazy and Inactive. In this caſe we uſe the Oyly Volatil Salts, and all Cordial, Cephalic and Aromatic Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines. Or,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Nerves are relaxated and render'd flaccid by a prevailing lymph, whether ſharp or acid. This yields to the ſame Remedies with the former.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Neighbouring fibres are over-charg'd and forc'd to Enormous motions, by the impetuous incurſions of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. In this Caſe Pacific Medicines are very proper. But they are generally ſuſpected, unleſs very well Prepar'd. <hi>Opium</hi> is the Head of 'em all; and may be Prepar'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Fermentation or Digeſtion with fix'd Salts.</p>
                  <p>Helmont Prepar'd it with Juice of Quinces, repeating the Fermentation thrice, and then diſſolv'd it in Spirit of Wine. Some ſet it to ferment with the Juice of Apples, or any other Stomachic. Langelot Mix'd it with Juice of Quinces, and ſet them in a moderat heat to fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. By this proceſs (ſays he) the ſtinking Sulphur is carried off, and the Groſs Earthy Parts fall to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, while the light and frothy Parts are mounted higher: And betwixt theſe two we find a Tranſparent Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, a little Reddiſh; which we ſeparat and reduce to the Conſiſtence of an Extract; and then Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it for a Month or two with Rectify'd Spirit of Wine. He extolls it for a Noble Medicine, but I never could ſee any extraordinary effects produc'd by it.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond and better way of Correcting <hi>Opium,</hi> is Digeſtion with Salt of Tartar and Spirit of Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin. 'Tis a Powerful Medicine, reſerv'd by ſome for a <hi>Noſtrum.</hi> Some Prepare it thus,</p>
                  <p>Take of <hi>Opium,</hi> Salt of Tartar, or Oyl of Tartar, <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> of each an Ounce. Let 'em ſtand for Digeſtion. Then pour upon 'em two or three Ounces of Spirit of Wine. It yields an excellent Tincture,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:207638:32"/>which is to be ſtrain'd and reſerv'd for uſe.—<hi>Coner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingius</hi> Prepar'd his Hyſteric <hi>Laudanum,</hi> thus,</p>

Tho', if conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd ſeparatly, either of 'em is lyable to Cenſure. The former, 'tis true, had a happy way of referring all the Corruptions of the Humors to the vicious efferveſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Acids and Alkali's. But he ſtretch'd the Notion too far, in imagining a ſtrife betwixt the Deſcending <hi>Lymph</hi> and aſcending <hi>Bile,</hi> in the right Ventricle of the Heart; and in aſcribing ſeveral effects to the conflicts of the Choler and Pancreatic Juice, which perhaps were only owing to the fermentation of the Choler alone. Moreover, he attributes a great many Sypmtoms to the Vapours ariſing from the Combatant Juices in the firſt Paſſages, which properly proceed from the mutual Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence of the Nerves. Upon the other hand <hi>Willis</hi> has ſet us in a clearer light with reference to Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Motions, and the Contractions of the Muſcles; but his Elaſtic Power will never be regarded, while the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions and Cramps of the Nerves are ſo probably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, by aſſigning the prevalency of an Acid, or ſome ſuch grating ſubſtance, for their Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two Authors joyn'd together are the flower of our Modern Writers, and as ſuch I recommend 'em to young Students.</p>
                  <p>As for Ancient Writers, <hi>Senertus</hi> may juſtly claim the precedency, or in Room of him <hi>Foreſtus. Helmont</hi> is an Author that ought to be read by all ſerious Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners. Since <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> we have none that ſurpaſſes him. But whoever would profit by reading his Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, muſt arm himſelf with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>atience, and Deliberatly weigh every Period, as he proceeds. In the next place,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:207638:33"/>he muſt be equip'd with a Competent Knowledge of Chymiſtry and Anatomy, elſe he does but grope in the dark. And beſides, what he Reads he ought to retain as a Paradox: And not yield his aſſent, till maturer thoughts and ſucceeding Experience have vouch'd for its Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</p>
                  <p>The Authors that have wrote Practical Obſervations, are <hi>Borellus, Salmuth, Tulpius, Rhodius, Bartholinus,</hi> &amp;c. They ought to be read with Judgment and Attention; Every Minute Circumſtance of the Patient ought to be nicely conſider'd, in order to find out the true cauſe of the Diſtemper, and determine the preciſe caſe in which any particular Medicine is Crown'd with ſucceſs.</p>

                  <p>THE moſt Natural method of deſcribing the Diſeaſes Incident to Men, Is to follow the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Functions in the Body. Among which, thoſe relating to Nouriſhment do juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lead the Van. The firſt function is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Solid Nouriſhment and Diſtribute it thro' the Body. This reception we are prompted to by Appetit. Which is a deſire of Solid Food, caus'd by the gnawing of a Volatil
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:207638:34"/>Acid in the Mouth of the Stomac; and encourag'd by ſuch Medicines as promote it. This Acid is vary'd according to the different Conſtitutions of Men, and accordingly directs the Appetit to different Objects. It is likewiſe influenc'd by the remains of preceding Food, and ſo ſways the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit to cuſtomary Meats. In like manner the Mother's Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination will Tincture the Acid in the Child's Stomac, with an invincible Averſion to ſome things. The leaſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion or Natural Senſe turns it. The Infant's uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from the Curdling of the Nurſes Milk, when ſhe is with Child in the time of ſuckling, will revive upon the ſight of Cheeſe, and oblige him to avoid it for ever. So inſenſibly is the Acid ſway'd, that without the direction of thought, it Naturally abhors it.</p>
                  <p>This Appetit, or deſire of eating is liable to theſe diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. 1. It is either impair'd and extinguiſh'd, or. 2. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd and apt to covet improper Food. Or, 3. Encreas'd to an Unnatural Degree. Of theſe in order,</p>
                  <div n="1" type="chapter">
                     <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of the Loſs of Appetit.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE place affected is the Mouth of the Stomac. The General Cauſe is the Ceſſation of the uneaſineſs which the Acid ferment was wont to produce, by Vellicating the Stomac.</p>
                     <p>The ſpecial Cauſes are Various. If the Nerves of the eight pair be diſorder'd, the Mouth of the Stomac becomes inſenſible, and ſo eludes the influence of the Acid. Theſe Nerves may be diſorder'd upon their own Account, or by conſent of other Parts, as in Nephritic and Colic Pains. Or, perhaps the Nerves are faultleſs, and the Spirits are ſtupify'd by the uſe of Narcotics, as <hi>Opium,</hi> or Tobacco. Or, are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and imploy'd upon other things, ſo as not to mind the impulſe of the ferment, as in the Caſe of Love, Grief, Madneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Nerves or Spirits be not faulty, the cauſe muſt be Lodg'd in the Stomac. Sometimes the Acid is blunted by a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:207638:34"/>ſuperfluity of viſcid matter in the Stomac: Or, the Spittle is become viſcid and takes off its edge, as in Hectic and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocondriac Perſons. (This laſt cauſe is effectually-remov'd by drinking Wine, in which Elecampane Roots, Horſe Rad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhes and Scurvy-Graſs have been infus'd.) The haſty ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing down of much meat, drinking new and fermenting Liquors, Cloying the Stomac with fat Oyly things, or acid and auſtere Fruits; do all cauſe a bluntneſs of the ferment. The frequent uſe of Brandy, or ſulphurous Liquors, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects the ſharpneſs of the acid and occaſions an inappetency. The fatneſs and redundancy of the Bile, whether in the Blood or Stomac, may alſo vitiat the ferment. When this cauſe takes place, 'tis known by a bitter taſte in the mouth, and a gnawing at the mouth of the Stomac. And Laſtly, the ſuppreſſion of wonted evacuations, as ſtopping of the Terms, or ſudden forbearing of Venery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> May concur to the ſame effect.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the acid it ſelf is deficient; If a Volatil Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler reign in the Blood, or the Spirits are ſo diſorder'd by a Feaver, or otherwiſe, that the alteration of the humors and particularly of the lympha is not regularly perform'd; or if the heat of Summer exhauſts the Spirits that ſhould ſerve to exalt the ferment. Immoderat drinking, eſpecially of whey which enjoys a temperat nitrous Salt, allays the acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ferment. The frequent uſe of Alcali's, as Chalk, Hartſhorn, and all Chalybeat medicines, little ſtones engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd in the Stomac, and the drinking of Urine (which is a ſpecific in hungry feavers) are frequently the cauſes of a weak ferment.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Prognoſtics.</hi> If it continue long in the beginning of a diſeaſe, it weakens nature, and adds force to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. If it do not decline along with the diſtemper, it portends a relapſe. In Chronical Diſeaſes and ſuch as come by Fits, it is the forerunner of the Paroxyſm. In Children it is more ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected than in adult Perſons. If the Appetit ſeem to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in general, and yet flags when Food is offer'd; Or, If after a loathing of meat, the Patient of a ſudden covet food and ſwallow it down greedily, 'tis a very bad <hi>Omen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the method of Cure, a particular regard muſt be had to the difference of cauſes, (which may eaſily be diſtinguiſh'd without a long train of Diagnoſtics.) Generally the peccant cauſe is the abounding of ſlimy humors, or of Choler or Fat in the Stomac. Which is only remov'd by evacuating Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:207638:35"/>Of which Vomits are the beſt. One Vomit is of more efficacy in this caſe than ten Purges. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of Mynſichtius's Emetic Tartar three Grains, fine ſugar ſix Grains, make a Powder. Or, if a liquid be more acceptable, exhibit the Infuſion of <hi>Crocus Metallorum,</hi> minding heedfully the quantity of the Liquor, and not the <hi>Crocus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When a viſcid Matter is lodg'd in the Stomach, 'tis fit to add ſome attenuating Ingredients. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of Hyſſop-water one or two Ounces, Cinnamom-water two Drams, Vinegar of Squills, and the Emetic Syrup (above preſcrib'd) of each half an Ounce, compound Spirit of Verdigreaſe from two Scruples to a Dram. Mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Patient do not Vomit eaſily, exhibit purging Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines; among which Aloe is the beſt, but it ought not to be waſh'd. It is a common Ingredient into Pills, and operates but very gently. If there be occaſion for a ſtronger Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, Take the Pills of <hi>Hiera</hi> with Agaric, adding to them Gum-ammoniac, or ſome attenuating Medicine. Thus,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Maſs of Pills of <hi>Hiera,</hi> with Agaric, from twelve to fifteen Grains, Extract of Wormwood (or Gum-ammoniac diſſolv'd in Vinegar) eight Grains, or half a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; <hi>Scammonium Sulphuratum,</hi> one Grain; Extract of the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <hi>Alhandal,</hi> from half a Grain to two Grains.</p>
                     <p>For thoſe who are Obnoxious to Hypochondriac Fits, the following Pills are very uſeful.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Pills of <hi>Hiera</hi> with Agaric half a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or twelve Grains; Gum-ammoniac diſſolv'd in Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar half a Scruple, Scammony prepar'd with Juice of Roſes two Grains, Extract of Troches <hi>Alhandal</hi> one Grain, with the Eſſence of Steel make Pills. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Pills of Maſtic fifteen Grains extract of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood twelve Grains, Extract of Troches <hi>Alhandal</hi> one Grain. Make Pills.</p>
                     <p>This purging Powder is likewiſe very good for Hypocon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driac Perſons, and ſuch as are eaſily purg'd, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Tartarum Vitriolatum</hi> fifteen Grains, Scammony prepar'd with Sulphur four Grains, Troches <hi>Alhandal</hi> one Grain, diſtill'd Oyl of Cummin-ſeeds two drops. Make a Powder.</p>
                     <p>If a Potion be more agreeable,</p>
                     <p>Take of Hyſſop-water, Mint-water of each half an Ounce; <hi>Tartarum Vitriolatum,</hi> and Extract of Agaric, of each ſix
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:207638:35"/>Grains, Scammony ſulphurated two Grains: Mix for a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So much for Purging Medicines.</p>
                     <p>After gentle Evacuations, we proceed to the uſe of ſuch Medicines as ſtrengthen the Walls of the Stomac, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the ſlimy Mucilage that ſticks to them. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all ſharp, volatil, and aromatic Medicines are proper, as the Stomachical Herbs, Spices, the hot Seeds, and Antiſcorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic's, eſpecially Horſe-Raddiſhes. Thoſe of a gentle aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent quality reſtore the Natural Conſtitution of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac, when vitiated by the uſe of Opium, ſtrong Liquors, Brandy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As for Acid Medicines, I cannot much approve them. I never ſaw any good Effect produc'd by them in this caſe, excepting Cream of Tartar, and the dulcify'd Spirit of Salt, or of Vitriol. 'Tis true they are fit to provoke the Stomac, and imitate Nature in prompting it to crave Food; but the Buſineſs of a Phyſician, is rather to remove the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances that annoy the Natural Function, than to ſupply an Artificial Appetit. The Eſſence of Bread diſtill'd thro' a Retort, is a ſovereign Reſtorer of the ferment. Theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines may be preſcrib'd thus.</p>
                     <p>Take of Wormwood, Mint, of each a handful; Roots of Acorus two Drams, Gentian Roots half an Ounce, the four hot Seeds of each two Drams. Slice and chop 'em ſmall. And tie them up in a Bag to be infus'd in Wine. Let the ſick Perſon drink a Draught twice a Day, adding to every Draught ſix Drops of dulcify'd Spirit of Salt. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of Mint three handfuls, freſh Roots of Acorus, two Ounces; Roots of Elecampane, or Horſe-Radiſhes, from one Ounce to an Ounce and a half, Zedoary Roots ſix Drams, Cinnamom three Drams, put them into a Bag, to be infus'd in Wine.</p>
                     <p>Take of Mint three handfuls, <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> one hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Wormwood Tops, and leſſer Centory, of each half a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Elecampane, and Evans Roots, of each half an Ounce. Muſtard-ſeeds, or Rocket-Seeds, one Ounce, Cinnamom two Drams, Cloves one Dram. Infuſe as above.</p>
                     <p>If ye deſire to make it a little looſening,</p>
                     <p>Take of Mint two handfuls, tops of Wormwood one hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Roots of Aron, Roots of Crude black Hellebor, of each half an Ounce, Roots of Elecampain, and the Leaves of pick'd Senna, of each one Ounce, Aniſeeds, Fennel-ſeeds, of each ſix Drams, Galangal, Zedoary and Ginger, of each two Drams, Salt of Tartar three Drams. Infuſe as above.</p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:207638:36"/>
                     <p>When the Spittle is glutinous, and the Mouth taſts bitter, the Roots of Horſe-Radiſhes and Elecampane in equal quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities infus'd in Rheniſh, or Wormwood-wine, or Pepper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd in like manner, or Wheaten-Bread dipp'd in Wine, or even a Draught of good generous Wine, are approved Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies; or <hi>Thonerius</hi>'s Decoction, thus.</p>
                     <p>Take of Cichory-Roots, of the Herbs, <hi>Roman</hi> Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> and Roſemary, of each a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; leſſer Centory a handful and a half: boil them in equal quantities of Wine and Water, till a third part be conſum'd. Doſe half a Pint Morning and Evening. Or <hi>Pachequus</hi> his Decoction of Agrimony, Wormwood, and leſſer Centory, in Water.</p>
                     <p>If ye pleaſe ye may add ſome temperat Acids: As,</p>
                     <p>Take of Mint-water two Ounces, Cinnamom-water from two Drams to ſix Drams, Juice of Quinces, from one Ounce to an Ounce and a half, Syrup of Quinces, either ſimple, or aromatis'd, from half an Ounce to ſix Drams. Mix and make a Potion, of which the Patient may take at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                     <p>Take of Mint-water one Ounce, Cinnamom-water half a Dram, Spirit of Treacle a Dram and a half, <hi>Laudanum Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atum</hi> prepar'd by fermentation two Grains, Syrup of Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mom half an Ounce. Mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Spirit of Maſtic and Spirit of Bread, and the Mineral Acid Spirits dulcify'd with Spirit of Wine, the dulcify'd Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Vitriol given from twenty to thirty drops in a warm Vehicle about two hours before eating, the volatil Salt of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are proper to this purpoſe. But they ought to be well qualify'd, or joyn'd with vegetable Stomachic's, as in <hi>Elixir proprietatis,</hi> which is a noble Medicine. For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Elixir proprietatis</hi> two Drams, Eſſence of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood and Mint, or Aromatic <hi>Calamus,</hi> of each a Dram. Mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Conſerve of the Pulp of Citrons an Ounce and a half, Conſerve of Mint <hi>Vitriolated</hi> one Dram, the red Hepatic Powder two Drams, Spirit of Salt coagulated, two Scruples, with a ſufficient quantity of the Syrup of Quinces ſpic'd, make an Electuary.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Michael</hi>'s Stomachical Elixir, is not improper in this caſe: As,</p>
                     <p>Take of Mint four handfuls, <hi>Roman</hi> Wormwood, Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, of each two handfuls, Sage, Penny-Royal, Baum,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:207638:36"/>of each one or two handfuls, Acorus-roots freſh three Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, (or dried one Ounce) Burnet or Elecampane-roots two Drams, round Cypreſs-roots one Dram, Maſtic ſix Drams, or an Ounce and a half or two Ounces; of the four hot Seeds of each half a Dram, Muſtard ſeed ſix Drams, of the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings of Saſſafras three Drams, Zedoary, Galangal of each a Dram and a half, or two Drams, or three Drams; of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bebs, Nutmegs, Mace, Cinnamom, Ginger, Cloves, of each three Drams or half an Ounce; Coriander-ſeed one Dram; pour upon 'em Spirit of Salt, or Philoſophical Spirit of Vitriol, (which is almoſt the ſame) as much as ſufficeth for a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſharpneſs. Extract the Tincture with Spirit of Mint. Strain it, and add as much of the compound Stomachical Extract, as it will bear. Doſe fifty or ſixty Drops. For a Scorbutic and Hypochondriac Conſtitution, it may be mix'd with the Spirit of Scurvy-graſs, taking a Dram and a half of the Spirit, to three Drams of the Elixir.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mynſichtius</hi> his <hi>Elixir Vitrioli,</hi> and the Eſſence of Amber, are much commended. And likewiſe Alcali's ſharpen'd with other Salts. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of the ſharpeſt Tincture of Tartar, and <hi>Elixir pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietatis</hi> prepar'd without the Acid, of each three Drams. Mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sal-armoniac is a good Stomachic, but it ought not to be joyn'd with fix'd Alcali's which drive away the volatil part of the Armoniac, and fix the remaining Acid. It ſucceeds better when joyn'd with Spices: As,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Flowers of Sal-armoniac, or depurated Sal-armoniack one Dram. The Powder call'd <hi>Diatrion Pipereon,</hi> or Powder of Cubebs, or any other Aromatic Powder, a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or half a Dram. Mix and make a Powder for three or four Doſes, of which the Patient may take one every Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of depurated Sal-armoniac one Dram, Ginger, and the Powder of <hi>Diatrion Pipereon</hi> of each a Scruple, or fifteen Grains. Mix for three Doſes. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of dried Aron roots one Dram; prepar'd Crabs-Eyes, Salt of Wormwood, of each from a Scruple to half a Dram, diſtill'd Oyl of Cloves three Drops. Mix for three Doſes. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of Aron-roots half a Dram, black Pepper a Dram and a half, Ginger half a Dram, Flowers of Sal-armoniac two Drams, diſtill'd Oyl of Aromatic <hi>Calamus</hi> a Scruple. Make a Powder. Or,</p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:207638:37"/>
                     <p>Take of the Conſerve of Wormwood-tops, Conſerve of Elecampane-roots of each two Drams, candy'd Ginger ſix Drams, Powder of <hi>Diatrion Pipereon,</hi> three Drams, Sal-armoniac one Dram, with the Syrup of Quinces make an Electuary.</p>
                     <p>Some uſe Sal-armoniac in Wormwood-wine. Tartar alſo and its various Productions, are very proper. And the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Stomachical Powders, ſuch as <hi>Michael</hi>'s, which is made thus.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Powder of dry'd Aron-roots two Pound, the Salt call'd <hi>Arcanum duplicatum</hi> one Pound, Salt of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, <hi>Arabian Coſtus,</hi> and Aromatic <hi>Calamus</hi>-roots of each two Ounces, Cinnamom and Cloves, of each an Ounce and a half, Mace, Long Pepper, Ginger, Cubebs, Cardamoms, Grains of Paradiſe, Zedoary, and Coriander-ſeeds, of each one Ounce. Mix and make a Powder. Doſe from a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to half a Dram.</p>
                     <p>If a ſhorter Proceſs be more agreeable,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Powder of Aron-roots one Dram, <hi>Arcanum duplicatum</hi> two Scruples, diſtill'd Oyl of Mint ſix Drops. Mix and make a Powder.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of the Depravation of the Appetite.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE Appetite is deprav'd when it avoids the proper, and craves improper Food. In the former Caſe, it avoids ſome particular Object thro' the prevalency of prejudice, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of a preceding Surfeit, or the confluence of vicious Humours in the Stomac. Thoſe who are troubled with a bitter Taſte in their Mouth, either through the uſe of Opium, or the height of a Fever, are averſe to Hopp'd Drink, by reaſon of the near reſemblance between the taſte of the Beer, and that which then annoys 'em. As the exhibiting of bitter Reſinous Purgatives will occaſion an Antipathy to Ale. Upon this account we take it for a good ſign in acute Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, if the Patient be able to drink Ale. Meat alſo is formidable to feaveriſh Conſtitutions, by reaſon that when eaten it is not digeſted, and ſo melts into a bitter muſty Crudity. Theſe are the Cauſes of an acquir'd Averſion to particular Meats, or Liquors. The Cure is perform'd by the uſe of <hi>Elixir proprietatis,</hi> Womrwood, Mint, Quinces, Wine, and their various Productions, together with ſome Acid Spirits.</p>
                     <p>The moſt remarkable Inſtances of deprav'd Appetites are what we call <hi>Pica</hi> and <hi>Malacia.</hi> The former is a Longing for ſuch things as are not fit to be eat, as raw Meat, Coals, Leather, Lime, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The latter is a violent and infatiable longing for uſual Food, as Herrins, and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>The Part affected, is partly the Orifice of the Stomach, where the appetiſing ferment is naturally ſeated; and partly the Fancy and Animal Spirits. For tho the Vellication of the Stomac conſtitute a general Appetit, 'tis the Fancy that directs it to a particular Object. Beſides, ſuch things are oft times long'd for, as are not Objects of the Stomach, as the crackling noiſe of Cinders, the ſmell of Leather, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which makes it to appear, that the Animal Spirits, and the Organs of Senſe, are deprav'd as well as the Stomach. That the Senſe of Smelling is vitiated, is evident from the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:207638:38"/>ſuch Perſons take in ſmelling to ſtinking unſavory Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. That the Senſe of Taſting is likewiſe corrupted, may be infer'd from the Depravation of the Spittle, occaſion'd by its Affinity to the Stomachical ferment; and is ſufficiently exemplified by their reliſhing and coveting the taſte of ſuch things, as at other times they abhor. The like may be ſaid of all the Senſes.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſe is the Alteration and Depravation of the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Stomac. We ſee that the various Modification of this ferment, in ſeveral Animals, creates in 'em contrary and diſtinct Appetites: by vertue of this diverſity of fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Men, Dogs, Cats, Geeſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are prompted to covet their peculiar Food.</p>
                     <p>The ferment is deprav'd by the corruption of Matter in the Stomac, which renders it ſaltiſh, ſharp, and in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure corroſive, and conſequently apt to overact its part, by vellicating the Mouth of the Stomach, in an unwonted man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and prompting the fancy to purſue and entertain unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Objects, after the method of Melancholic Hypocondri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac Fits, to which this Diſtemper is near ally'd.</p>
                     <p>The occaſional remote Cauſes are, the Suppreſſion of the Terms, which occaſion the Stagnation and Corruption of the Blood, and by conſequence of the Lymph, which wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the Coats of the Stomach; Ulcers in the Throat diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling corrupt Matter into the Stomac: The ſuppreſſion of the Genital Liquor, or any wonted Evacuation, and an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Conveyance from Mothers liable to this Diſeaſe; which is equally compatible to Men and Women, Maids and Mothers.</p>
                     <p>The things coveted and Long'd for in a <hi>Pica,</hi> are ſuch as are agreeable to the vicious ferment, which is ſo fierce and keen, that it digeſts without any trouble, or harm, a great many noxious and offenſive Objects; providing their quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity taken down, do not exceed the extent of the Appetit. 'Tis true indeed, that if abſurd and uncommon things are frequently eat, tho' in the mean time they occaſion no viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſturbance, yet they amaſs deprav'd Humours in the Body, and ſo cauſe Dropſies, Cachexies, and many diſmal Symptoms. As for Child-bearing Women, who are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently obnoxious to irregular Appetites, if they cannot be diſſuaded by rational Motives, they muſt be furniſh'd with what they Long for, for fear of bad conſequences happening to the Child in the Belly.</p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:207638:39"/>
                     <p>The Cure is perform'd by evacuating the Stomach, and tempering the ferment. Vomits, and particularly <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Vitae,</hi> are very proper, if occaſional Circumſtances do not forbid 'em, ſuch as a natural difficulty of Vomiting, the firſt and laſt Months of a Womans being with Child, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in which caſe let Purges of Aloe, Extract of Hellebor, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquintida, and ſweet Mercury be exhibited. It will not be improper to mix both the Vomiting and Purging Medicines with the things Long'd for, that ſo the ferment eagerly joyning them may be carried off. If the whole Maſs of Humours be deprav'd, Antimonial Sudorifics are very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</p>
                     <p>After Evacuation, let the vicious ferment be temper'd by moderat Acids, and palatable Stomachics, ſuch as the Jui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Quinces, of Lemons, Citrons, Pomgranats, and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranges; the Water of the Sprigs of Vines, mix'd with Spirit of Treacle; Capers pickl'd in Vinegar, and mix'd with Carminative Seeds; Eſſence of Orange-peel mix'd with Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Saffron (in a ſuppreſſion of the Terms;) the Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Parſley-roots with Chiches, and eſpecially Wine in which Mint and Wormwood are infus'd.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Vitriolated Conſerve of Mint four Ounces, powder of Zedoary a Dram or two, with Syrup of Quinces, make an Electuary, of which let the Patient take a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent quantity thrice a Day.</p>
                     <p>Take of Mint-water, Baum-water, of each an Ounce; Cinnamon-water prepar'd with Quinces ſix Drams; Juice of Quinces an Ounce; with a ſufficient quantity of dulcify'd Spirit of Salt make a Potion. Doſe a Spoonful now and then.</p>
                     <p>Let Syrups or ſweet things be ſparingly us'd. Treacle and Mithridate are ſometimes very uſeful. When other things fail, we muſt have recourſe to Steel and abſorbent Powders. Bleeding is of no direct uſe in this Diſeaſe, tho in a ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Terms, or Plethora, it may be ſerviceable by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the occaſional Cauſe.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of an Immoderat Appetit, and Dog Hunger.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>AN extraordinary Appetit returning by intervals, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by Swooning, is call'd <hi>Bulimus.</hi> If Victuals be ſpeedily ſwallow'd down without Chewing, and frequently Vomited up, or at leaſt ſo ſpeedily digeſted, that the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Appetit is not diſcontinu'd, 'tis call'd a Dog-Hunger.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſe of 'em both for the moſt part is a Volatil, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engag'd Acid, call'd by the Ancients Melancholy, that gnaws and provokes the Mouth of the Stomac. Accordingly we find that Acids augment, and viſcous Anti-acids impair the Appetit. 'Tis true, a volatil Urinous Alcali, ſuch as the Bile, abounding in the Stomac, may ſometimes increaſe the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit, and in that caſe Acids perform the Cure. If the Nervous Membrane of the Stomach be over ſenſible, and too eaſily provok'd, an extraordinary Appetit may likewiſe inſue thereupon.</p>
                     <p>Worms in the Stomac, or Guts, may vellicate the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brans, and ſo create an Appetit; and if the Digeſtion withal be eaſie and quick, it argues that there's an acid Matter in the Stomac beſides Worms. 'Tis but very ſeldom that a <hi>fames Canina</hi> is periodical, neither is it follow'd by Fatneſs, by reaſon of the rough unpliable Craſis of the Blood. Long Faſting, and any immoderat Evacuation of Blood or Chyle, may be liſted into the number of its External Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
                     <p>In a <hi>Bulimus</hi> the Cauſes are ſomewhat meeker, attended by a dullneſs or want of Spirits. When it ſucceeds to Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Diſeaſes, or when the Swooning Fits happen while the Belly is full, 'tis dangerous. If a Dog Hunger be attended by Vomiting and Looſeneſſes, it degenerates into Gache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xies, Dropſies, Conſumptions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:207638:40"/>
                     <p>The Cure conſiſts in tempering and evacuating the Acid. The former Indication muſt be firſt ſatisfied; for if we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to evacuate the Acid in its vicious State, it will grow fiercer, and more offenſive. The tempering Remedies are fix'd and volatil Alcali's, abſorbent Earthy Powders, and fat Oyly Medicines. The firſt kill the Acidity, as appears by mixing Salt of Tartar with Spirit of Vitriol. The ſecond ſuck up the acid Particles, as is evident by the Experiment of Vinegar and Crabs Eyes. The laſt cramp and fetter the Acid.</p>
                     <p>Of the firſt ſort are the Vegetable fix'd Salts, Salt and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Urine, Spirit of Hartſhorn, Onyons, Garlick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of the ſecond are Crabs Eyes, Coral, Pearls, Chalk, Blood-Stone, Bole-armenic, Seal'd Earth, Steel prepar'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Acids, and mix'd with Opiats. Of the third ſort, are the expreſs'd Oyl of Sweet Almonds, Linſeed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> diſtill'd Oyls of Aniſeed, Caraway-ſeed, and eſpecially of Cloves, the Yelks of Eggs boil'd hard, or the Oyl of Eggs, hot Bread dipp'd into Oyl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if the Diſeaſe be attended by Vomiting, the Oyly Ingredients ought to be avoided, or their uſe diſcontinu'd, when the Hunger relents.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Filings of Steel, and prepar'd Coral, of each half a Dram, prepar'd Crabs Eyes a Scruple, prepar'd Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Pearl, and Bone of Carp of each a Scruple, Saffron half a Scruple, <hi>Laudanum Opianum</hi> two Grains: Mix for two or three Doſes to be exhibited in fat Broth.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the abovementioned Ingredients, ſome recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the drinking of Wine, others Cockles, River Crabs, Pork, Brains fry'd with Butter, Rice boyl'd with Milk and Butter, Fiſtic-Nuts, Sweet-Almonds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sweet Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Wines, in which Mint and Sage are infus'd, or the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of thoſe Herbs, or the Eſſence of Wormwood, Penny-royal, Baum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> mix'd with diſtill'd Oyls, are much approv'd.</p>
                     <p>Narcotics ſtupify the Mouth of the Stomach, and upon that ſcore are uſeful. But this Cure is only palliative. Treacle and Mithridate are the beſt of 'em.</p>
                     <p>The Acid being thus prepar'd, let Vomits be exhibited, or Purges, ſuch as this.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Pills of <hi>Hiera</hi> a Scruple, choice Rhubarb in Powder half a Scruple, with Syrup of Roſes: Make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>SECT. III. <hi>Of the Diſorders of Thirſt.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THIRST proceeds from the Vellication of the Gullet, Throat, Palat, Tongue, and adjacent parts, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd by ſharp ſaline Particles. The Liquor it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands is naturally deſign'd for a Vehicle to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Food and Excrements. 'Tis diſorder'd by way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, Diminution, or Depravation.</p>
                  <p>The two laſt are very uncommon. 'Tis true there are ſome few Inſtances of a want of Thirſt, among Children and Splenetic Perſons; and wherever 'tis found, it muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a redundacy of moiſture about the Stomac and Throat, or the ſtupidity of thoſe parts. Either of which Cauſes is remov'd by the uſe of <hi>Elixir proprietatis,</hi> Tincture of Tartar, Tartar vitriolated, <hi>Arcanum Duplicatum,</hi> Sal-armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac mix'd with Spices, Salt of <hi>Carduus Benedictus, &amp;c.</hi> If it be caus'd by the inadvertency of the mind, and delirous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition of the Spirits, as in Feavers, 'tis a bad ſign, but yields to the general Cure of the Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>As for the Depravation of Thirſt, or a particular averſion to ſome Liquors, and violent inclination to others, 'tis ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Symptom of a Feaver, or accompanies a Pica or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacia, and requires the ſame Cure as its Companions.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of Immoderat Thirſt.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IT remains now to take a View of Immoderat Thirſt, the only diſorder of that Nature that requires conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this place. The part affected is the Throat, Gullet,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:207638:41"/>and Mouth of the Stomach. The cauſe is either poſitive, or privative. The poſitive cauſe is a ſharp Salt vellicating theſe parts, which, if it be lock'd up in a viſcous Vehicle, is not ſo eaſily diluted as otherwiſe. This Salt is of an Alcalin na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, contrary to that which cauſes immoderat Hunger. The privative cauſe is the Defect of <hi>Saliva,</hi> whoſe Office 'tis to water thoſe parts, and dilute the Salts.</p>
                     <p>The remote external Cauſes are Purging Medicines, Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Salt, Spices, Arſenic, ſublimat Mercury, talking loud, ſleeping with the Mouth open, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The internal remote Cauſes are the prevalency of a bitter Oyl in the Choler, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praving the Lymph; an Oyly ſharpneſs in the Saliva occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd by Catarrhs, extravaſation of Serum, or Scorbutic glutinous Lymph; the Deficiency, Glutinoſity, and Saltiſh ſharpneſs of the Saliva, as in Feavers, Phthiſicks, Hectics, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which we may add the diſorder, diverſion, or pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Spirits, which hinder the due ſecretion of the Spittle, as in the Inſtances of Weakneſs, Fatigue, Anger, Pain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The heat of the Blood in the Lungs, and dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Appetit in the Stomac, have likewiſe a great hand in cauſing Thirſt. Sometimes Thirſt is attended by a Feaveriſh heat; at other times it is quite free of it, as in Scorbutic, Hydropic, and Catarrhous caſes.</p>
                     <p>In general a ſudden Thirſt without any viſible cauſe, prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticates ſome Diſeaſe or other. If the Tongue be dry, the Mouth beſet with a tough Phlegm, and the Body oppreſs'd with heat, and yet the Perſon be inſenſible of Thirſt, 'tis an Argument of a Delirium, or great diſorder among the Animal Spirits, or of the ſtupidity of the Tongue, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent parts, and is juſtly look'd upon as a malignant Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. If in drinking the Liquor makes a noiſe as it falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Stomac, it is an Argument of the Diſorder of the Stomac. In Feavers it diſappears together with them. But in Chronical Diſtempers, 'tis not ſo eaſily ſhaken off.</p>
                     <p>As for the method of Cure, the irritating Cauſe muſt be firſt remov'd by Medicines vary'd according to its Nature. Such are partly auſtere Acids, partly temperat Medicine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> which correct the ſharp, or urinous, or oyly, or ſaline Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. The Acids are Wood-ſorrel, Prunes, Citrons, Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Oranges, Pomgranates, Rasberries, Barberries, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, Cherries, and all their Juices; and eſpecially Tama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinds, which not only abate the Thirſt, but open the Body.

                     <p>The ſecond Indication of Cure is to augment the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Serum and Spittle by exhibiting Liquids alter'd with Wine or Cinnamom, or mix'd with acid Spirits. Simple cold Water, tho' commonly us'd, is very noxious. Beſides, 'tis not convenient to throw in too large quantities of Liquors for fear of loading the Stomac, therefore Gargles and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilages applied to the Tongue and Throat will not be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. As for the Forms of <hi>Recipe's</hi> theſe following will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Decoction of the Leaves and Roots of Wood-ſorrel one Pound, freſh Juice of Wood-ſorrel three Ounces, Syrup of Bay-berries and Pomgranats, of each ſix Drams. Mix them.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Decoction of Barly one Pound, Juices of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons and of Quinces, of each two Ounces; Tinctures of the Flowers of Daſies and Roſes of each two Drams, Syrup of the Juice of Citrons, an Ounce and a half; Spirit of Salt as much as ſufficeth. Make a Julep.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Flowers of Daſies ſix Drams, ſprinkle 'em with Spirit of Sulphur, and infuſe 'em in two Pound of Barly-water, till it extract a Tincture: ſtrain the Liquor, and add three Ounces of the Syrup of Rasberries.</p>
                     <p>Take of Tamarinds two Ounces, bruis'd ſmall Raiſins, an Ounce and a half, boil them in Water, and infuſe in the ſtrain'd Liquor while 'tis yet hot an Ounce of freſh Citron-peel. When 'tis cold ſtrain it out, and add half an Ounce of the Tincture of Roſes. Make a Julep.</p>
                     <p>Take of Barly-water, a Pound and a half, Cinnamom-water an Ounce, purify'd Nitre, or <hi>Nitrum Antimoniatum,</hi> from a Dram to a Dram and a half. Mix them for a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This and all Nitrous Potions are proper for ſuch as do not agree with Acids.</p>
                     <p>In Scorbutic, Phthyſical and Hydropic Caſes the Saltneſs of the Lymph and Spittle is admirably corrected by Whey mix'd with Juice of Citrons, or with the Juices of Scurvy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graſs and Wood-ſorrel. Spirits of Salt and of Nitre are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe very proper. Emulſions prepar'd from the cooling and milky Seeds, and the Decoction of China with Raiſins and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:207638:42"/>Liquorice are likewiſe conducive to the ſame purpoſe. Acids in this caſe are improper. But Liquorice and Fennel-Seeds boil'd are much approv'd. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of Barly a handful, ſmall Raiſins bruis'd an ounce and a half, Anniſeeds, Fennel ſeeds, of each a Dram and a half, Liquorice-roots ſix Drams: Boyl them in fair Water till the fourth part be conſum'd, adding towards the end a Dram and a half of Cinnamon. Strain out the Liquor, of which the Patient may drink at pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>Gargles of Water; Small-beer or Water impregnated with Nitre, or the Juice of Houſeleek; or Mucilages of Quince-ſeeds, Fleawort-ſeeds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> extracted with Roſe-water, or Phlegm of Vitriol, and mix'd with the Juice of Houſeleek; applied to the Tongue and held in the Mouth, are very uſeful; eſpecially when the Tongue is black, dry, and rough.</p>
                     <p>Some healthy Perſons are moleſted with Thirſt every Morning, for whom Wormwood-wine is very proper. Others are thirſty thro' Labour, Fatigue, and Exerciſe, for whom the Spirit of Wine is very convenient.</p>

                     <p>THE Temporal Muſcles, and thoſe common to the Cheeks and Lips, are the Inſtruments which move the under Jaw-bone, in order to joyn it with the upper in the Act of Chewing, If they are ſeiz'd with Convulſions or Cramps, the under Jaw-bone is inſeparably united to the upper; if they be Paralytic, it falls down by its own weight, and they are not able to fetch it up. But theſe Cramps and Palſies
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:207638:43"/>never happen but when the whole Body is equally affected, and then they yield to the general Cure.</p>
                     <p>If one part or ſide of theſe Muſcles be ſeiz'd with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, or Palſy, while the other is ſound, the Mouth ſtands awry inclining to one ſide. In which poſture one of the Eyes cannot be duly ſhut, neither can the Perſon pronounce the Letter <hi>O</hi> with a full Mouth, or Spit but at one ſide of the Mouth. If it be a Palſy, the part affected is looſe, ſoft, and follows the Motion of the ſound Muſcles, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Eyelid falls down; whereas if it be a Cramp, or Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the part is hard, painful, and draws the ſound Muſcles to it.</p>
                     <p>As for the Cauſes of Convulſions and Palſies they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for elſewhere. This Contorſion is a fatal Symptom in acute continual Feavers, or after an univerſal Apoplexy or Epilepſy.</p>
                     <p>The Cure is accompliſh'd by Purgative Medicines, vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til and aromatic Sudorifics, decoctions of Woods, Caſtor gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven inwardly, or its Eſſence apylied outwardly, or its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract roll'd in the Mouth. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of Nutmegs two Drams; Roots of Pellitory of <hi>Spain,</hi> and of Angelica, Seeds of Staves-acre, Muſtard-ſeeds, of each a Dram; Cumin-ſeeds and Cubebs, of each half a Dram; Pepper half a Scruple; Maſtic, a Dram and a half; with Wax make Tablets to be roll'd in the Mouth. The Mouth may be waſh'd with Spirit of Wine, in which Caſtor is diſſolv'd, or the Decoction of Pellitory-roots with Rocket-ſeeds. Platerus was wont to cure the Convulſive diſtortion of the Mouth by Opiats mix'd with Aromatics; as Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat, Syrup of Poppies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If the Caſe be Paralytic, Bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering Plaiſters may be applied to the Ear, or Nap of the Neck.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of the Loſs, Corruption, Blackneſs, Looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Numneſs, and Chilneſs of the Teeth.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE Teeth are nouriſh'd not only by the Arteries and Veins inſerted into their Roots; but likewiſe by the Gums. When they are uncapable thro' Age, or otherwiſe, to receive Nouriſhment they fall out, or are ground away by continual uſe.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes which promote this their decay, are the abuſe of Stupifying, or Narotic, over cold, or over hot Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, or of Viſcous and Corruptible things, which ſtick to the ſides of the Teeth, and corrupt their Nouriſhment, ſuch as Sugar, Sweet-meats, Figs, Cheeſe, Milk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Scurvy, Salivation, handling of Mercury, external Violence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Cure conſiſts in removing the Cauſes. If Mercury be the cauſe, Leaves of Gold or Solar Preparations are very proper.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the Teeth are corrupted thro' the acidity of their own direct Nouriſhment, or of that receiv'd ſideways from the Gums. External Injuries are apt to produce the ſame Effect. At firſt there appears a black Spot in the Tooth, then it becomes a Hole, and the Tooth grows hollow; the corrupted Matter lodg'd within corodes the Tooth, cauſes pain, and ſometimes reaches the Gums and Jaw-bone, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Ulcers, which degenerate into Fiſtula's. Sometimes the corrupted Matter degenerates into Worms. Sometimes the Teeth ſtink and infect the Breath, by reaſon of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Meat ſticking in their Chinks, or in the hollow Tooth.</p>
                     <p>If the Corruption be confirm'd, it cannot be Cur'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out drawing the Tooth. The Juice of Sun-ſpurge mix'd with Sal-armoniac and Flour, and put into the Hollow-Tooth,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:207638:44"/>will render the Operation eaſy; the Juice of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landin the greater, or a bruis'd Graſhopper, are proper for the ſame purpoſe. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of Gum-ammoniac, Henbane-ſeeds, Juice of Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane, of each a Dram and a half; with the fat of Green Frogs and Wax make an Ointment, to be applied to the Tooth before 'tis drawn.</p>
                     <p>If the Corruption be not too far advanc'd, a ſtop may be put to its further progreſs by applying an actual Cautery; and afterwardsfilling the Tooth with Gold-leaf beat up with Myrrh and Wax; or with Turpentine; or with the Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Ginger in Oxymel; or with Coral and Camphyr. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of prepar'd red Coral, bone of a Cuttle, and burnt Hartſhorn, of each two Scruples; choice Myrrh, half a Dram; Camphyr, five or ſix Grains, with the mucilage of Traga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canth make Pills, to be put into the Hollow-Tooth. Some chooſe potential Cautery's inſtead of actual ones, as <hi>Aqua-Fortis,</hi> or the Spirit of Salt.</p>
                     <p>If the Teeth ſtink let 'em be waſh'd with Water, in which Sal-armoniac is diſſolv'd. If they are infeſted with Worms, waſh 'em with the Decoction of Savin in Wine, or apply the Spirit of Sulphur with Cotton, or let the fumes of burnt Henbane-ſeed be receiv'd at the Mouth.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes if the Gums be flaccid, looſe, or otherwiſe diſorder'd, the lateral Nouriſhment they afford to the Teeth, is viciated, and ſticks like an Excrement upon their ſurface, and either grows hard like a friable Stone, or blackens and diſorders the Teeth. Hence we ſee that whatever affects the Gums, as the Scurvy, Mercurial Salivation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by a blackneſs, and ſordid colour of the Teeth.</p>
                     <p>If this Symptom be recent and not confirm'd, let the Teeth and Gums be rub'd with the following Powder.</p>
                     <p>Take of burnt Hartſhorn, three Ounces; Coral, a Dram and a half; Roots of Florentine Orris, two Scruples; burnt Allum and Salt of Tartar, of each a Scruple, make a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be ſprinkled with Spirit of Scurvy-graſs, adding ſome drops of the diſtill'd Oyl of Cloves.</p>
                     <p>If the Excrement be ſtiff and confirm'd, let Spirit of Salt mix'd with Honey be applied to the Gums and Teeth. Or, Take a Polypody-root, and ſoak it for the ſpace of four and twenty Hours in Wine ſharpen'd with Spirit of Sulphur. Then dry it for a Powder for the Teeth. Let the Teeth and Gums be waſh'd every Morning with Human Urine, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eating with Plantan and Houſeleek-water, in which Sal-armoniac
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:207638:45"/>and Salt of Tartar are diſſolv'd. The Powders of hard ſtones, ſuch as Flint, Pumice-ſtone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not ſo convenient, unleſs it be in a very inveterat caſe; becauſe they conſume the Gums.</p>
                     <p>As touching the looſeneſs of the Teeth, 'tis occaſion'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by their own intrinſic fault, of which above, or the relaxation of the Fibres of the Gums, which frequently proceeds from the ſharpneſs of the Saliva, or Serum, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the aptneſs of the Scurvy, Tooth-ach, and Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Salivation, to cauſe it. Opiats alſo, us'd for the Tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, ſometimes cauſe a looſeneſs of the Teeth by relaxating the Fibres of the Gums.</p>
                     <p>If it be inveterat it may run to that height, that the Gums are exulcerated, corrupted and diſpos'd to a Gangrene. Sometimes if the Texture of the Gums is very ſolid, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxating Cauſes aſſault it, it ſhoots up a looſe flaccid ſordid ſort of Fleſh that 'twines about and covers the Tooth.</p>
                     <p>The Cure conſiſts in corroborating the flaccid Gums by Aſtringents, cleanſing the Ulcers (if any there be) and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving them from further Corruption. Tincture of Lac, with Myrrh, is a noted Medicine for this Effect. Spirit of Salt with Honey of Roſes, is alſo a powerful cleanſer.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Flowers of Holyhocks, half an Ounce; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd burnt Hartſhorn, two Drams; burnt Allum, Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs, of each a Dram. Make a Powder to rub the Gums with, after cleanſing the Teeth, and waſhing the Mouth with the following Gargle.</p>
                     <p>Take of Sage-leaves, two handfuls; Flowers of Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hocks, one handful; Polypody-roots half an Ounce. Boyl them in fair Water. To a Pound of the ſtrain'd Decoction, add Honey of Roſes, two Ounces and a half; Antimonial Nitre, three Drams; burnt Allum and ſeal'd Earth, of each a Dram. Mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of the Leaves of Sage and Scurvy-graſs, of each three handfuls; boyl them in Milk. To a Pound of the ſtrain'd Liquor add freſh Juice of Scurvygraſs two Ounces; Syrup of Columbines four Ounces. Mix for an Antiſcorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Gargle.</p>
                     <p>Take of crude Allum a Dram and a half; Flowers of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbines and Sage-leaves, of each two Drams; Roots of Florentin-Orris, three Drams; choice Myrrh, two Scruples. Sprinkle 'em liberally with Spirit of Scurvygraſs, adding a few Drops of the diſtill'd Oyl of Cloves. Make a Liniment for the Teeth.</p>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:207638:45"/>
                     <p>For a Scorbutic Excreſcence of the Gums, Spirit of Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vygraſs mix'd with burnt Allum, is very proper; or the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of ſmall Houſeleek with Allum and Hony; or a mixture of the Scum of Quicklime Water with Lac, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol and Roſe-water; are much approv'd.</p>
                     <p>If the Excreſcence be over luxuriant, we muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Decoction of Verdigriſe and Allum mix'd with Vinegar, or the Ointment <hi>Aegyptiacum</hi> mix'd with Hony of Roſes; or the following Powder.</p>
                     <p>Take of burnt Allum and Sal-armoniac, of each a Scruple; Maſtic and Frankincenſe, of each half a Dram. Make a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be rub'd upon the Teeth, after waſhing the Mouth with the Decoction of Sage, Tormentil and red Roſes.</p>
                     <p>The Numneſs of the Teeth proceeds from the Acidity of the Lymph, and is cur'd by chewing freſh Purſlain, or Cheeſe; or applying the White of an Egg boyl'd hard; but eſpecially by warm Urine.</p>

                  <p>The Depravation of the Swallowing Faculty diſcovers it ſelf three ways. 1. When Liquors can be taken down, but no ſolid thing. 2. When ſolid things are eaſily receiv'd, but ſuch as are liquid are thrown up by the Mouth and Noſtrils; by reaſon that the <hi>Epiglottis</hi> does not duly cover the opening of the Wind-pipe. 3. When ſome things both ſolid and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid are eaſily taken down, and ſome are not. Of which more under the Head of a Queaſy Stomac.</p>
                  <p>In acute Diſeaſes or Wounds, the Convulſion of the Gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let is fatal; as alſo its relaxation for want of Spirits.

                  </head>
                  <p>THE Food convey'd by the Mouth and Gullet into the Stomac, is there diſſolv'd, partly by the heat of the Stomac and adjacent Bowels, and partly by the ſalin and ſpirituous Juice in the Stomac; which likewiſe encounters the alcalin Salts of the Food, when diſſolv'd, and by means of a fermentation works it into a volatil tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perat milky ſubſtance, which we call Chyle.</p>
                  <p>That this ferment in the Stomac is an acid ſalin ſubſtance, is ſufficiently made out by the acid Belchings that attend even thoſe who are well; by the evident vertue which Acids have of promoting, and fat oyly Anti-acids of impairing the Appetit. The original of this ferment is the Lymph depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited by the Glandules of the Stomach into its Cavity, where it meets the remains of Food, impregnated with Spittle, and render'd acid by delay; and combines with 'em in the form of an acid ferment.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>IF the Food be not ſufficiently elaborat in the Stomac, and in due time converted into Chyle; it remains unfit for nouriſhing the Body, as being nothing but a heap of crude Matter. Sometimes it melts into a fix'd Viſcous acid, that falling ſhort of its due thinneſs and volatility, is the ſource of all Chronical Diſtempers; which by the Ancients were
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:207638:47"/>imputed to the unequal Diſpoſition of the Bowels, or the cold Conſtitution of the Stomac complicated with the heat of the Liver. This we call the acid Crudity of the Stomac. At other times it degenerates into a <hi>Cruditas Nidoroſa,</hi> a putrid Matter ſmelling like ſomething burnt or roaſted.</p>
                     <p>The cauſes of theſe Diſorders are the deficiency, confuſion, or flatneſs of the Spirits, thro' Weakneſs, Paſſions, Pains, and want of Exerciſe; the corruption or fixation of the acid ferment occaſion'd by vicious Acids, ſweet things, and ſuch as tend to an acid Crudity; or its dullneſs and inactivity, occaſion'd by the oyly Salt of the Choler abounding in the the Stomac, eating of fat Food, as Eggs fry'd with a large quantity of Butter, and ſuch like, which produce a <hi>Crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas Nidoroſa;</hi> the fixation and viſcidity of the Reliques of preceding Digeſtions in the Pleats of the Stomac, following the prepoſterous adminiſtration of fix'd abſorbent Powders in Feavers; eating of diſagreeable and unwonted Food, which renverſes the Seminal Craſis of the ferment, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a new proportion of digeſtive Salts; (whereas the Food that the Appetit calls for, and is by cuſtom well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, meets with a more wellcome reception from the ferment, that is in ſome meaſure ally'd to it by vertue of the remains of food of the ſame Nature lodg'd in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac; the Relaxation, Exulceration, Excoriation and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Stomac; Its Sympathy with the Kidneys in Nephritic Pains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe Cauſes relate to the Stomac, and its ferment.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes relating to the Object or Food receiv'd; are gormandizing, or over-charging the Stomac and ferment; variety of contrary Meats which are not equally digeſted, one part remaining crude, while the other is already trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd; departing from the uſual Meaſures and Seaſons of Eating, or anticipating Meals before the former be digeſted; croſſing the Natural Appetit by preſſing ſuch things as are loath'd, and denying that it long'd for; abſtaining from Bread, or uſing ſuch as is not ſufficiently fermented and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with that volatil Acid that ſo notably promotes Digeſtion; hard, viſcous, and oyly Food, or ſuch as is not eaſily diſſolv'd or mix'd with watery Vehicles; exceſſive Drinking, which over dilutes the ferment, relaxes the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres of the Stomac, and cauſes the Food to float unſteddily; Eating of ſolid Foot without a ſufficient quantity of moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture for its Vehicle; neglect of Chewing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:207638:48"/>
                     <p>The particular Cauſes of an acid Crudity are the redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy of acid Humours in the Body, the frequent uſe of Acids, whether open or occult, or of Spices and ſuch like ſharp things, as are apt to exalt an Acid.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe of a muſty Crudity are the recoyling of the Bile and Alcalin Humors; the deficiency of Acids, as in acute Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; the undue ſtay of Food in the Stomac; or the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Pylorus ſtopping its paſſage; uſing fat oyly fix'd or Chalybeat Ingredients; ſoon periſhing Fruits; in a word whatever is apt to corrupt, or contract a Nidor.</p>
                     <p>The Symptoms of an impair'd Chalification are; a heavy pain about the Stomac, and diſtention of the Breaſt, after eating; frequent Belchings whether inſipid, putrid, ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous, or reſembling the very taſte of the Food, tho' five or ſix Hours after eating. Sometimes, eſpecially in Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driac Perſons, the Face is inflam'd, and reſpiration is difficult while they lie on their Backs. In a Morning their Mouth is beſet with a viſcous Phlegm. The Urine is ſometimes thin and watry, at other times thick and muddy. Sometimes a Vertigo happens attended by all the Symptoms of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriac Illneſs, which takes its riſe from the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of an acid Crudity, are Heart-burning, acid Belchings; much Wind; the Conſtipation of the Belly, and the thickneſs and viſcidity of whatever is vomited up, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Naturally or by Art. Thoſe of a muſty Crudity are theſe. In the Morning they perceive an uncouth aſhy Taſte, like that of rotten Wood; afterwards a gnawing in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac, and loathing of Meat, with a Bitterneſs in the Mouth; their Belchings reſemble the taſte of rotten Fiſh, or fry'd Eggs; the Belly is open and looſe, and what they vomit is either inſipid or bitteriſh.</p>
                     <p>As for Prognoſtics. An acid Crudity is the fore-runner and cauſe of Intermitting Feavers, Hypocondriac Illneſs, Scurvy, Cachexies, Colic Paſſions, Arthritic and Nephritie Pains, Melancholy and fore'd Eruptions in the Skin. In a word 'tis the ſource of all the Chronical Dſtempers, which by the Ancients were refer'd to the Obſtructions of the Bowels, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery, Liver, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>Chylification is the Work of Nature, not to be compaſs'd by Art. Wherefore the Cure conſiſts only in removing the offenſive Crudity, cleanſing the Stomach, and gently whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Appetite.</p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:207638:48"/>
                     <p>In the firſt place Antimonial Vomits mix'd with attenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Ingredients are requir'd. Then Stomachical Purges of Hiera with Agaric, Aloe and Maſtic. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Pills call'd <hi>Aleophanginae,</hi> a Scruple; Tartar vitriolated, ſix Grains; Scammony ſulphurated, two Grains; Extract of Troches Alhandal (a Noble Medicine for cutting pituitous Humours) a Grain and a half, with the Tincture of Tartar make Pills.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Quercetanus</hi>'s Pills of Ammoniac a Scruple; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of Steel, half a Scruple; Extract of Troches Alhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, two Grains; diſtill'd Oyl of Mace, two Grains: With <hi>Elixir Proprietatis,</hi> or Eſſence of Saſſafras, or Eſſence of Mint, or Spirit of Maſtic, make Pills. Or a Purging Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine may be made of Salts, Thus,</p>
                     <p>Take of Tartar vitriolated, Cream of Tartar, of each half a Scruple, Scammony ſulphurated four Grains; Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Alhandal, two Grains; Diſtill'd Oyl of Anniſeeds, two Drops, make a Powder. If a Liquid Form be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd,</p>
                     <p>Take of Wormwood, or Hyſſop-water, Mint-water, of each half an Ounce; Tartar vitriolated, Extract of Agaric, of each half a Scruple, Extract of Troches Alhandal, one Grain; Scammony ſulphurated, two Grains; ſolutive Syrup of Roſes, half an Ounce. Mix for a Potion.</p>
                     <p>Of Alterative Medicines Galangal and Ginger are much the beſt. Next are the Carminative Seeds, Anniſeeds, Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-ſeeds, Cumin-ſeeds, the four leſſer hot Seeds; Acorus-roots preſerv'd; Nutmeg, not by it ſelf, but in conjunction with Stomachic Simples; among which Mint and Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood lead the Van. Next to them are Myrrh, Zedoary, Roſemary, Saſſafras, Quinces, dulcify'd Spirit of Salt (an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Remedy) Spirit of Maſtic mix'd with that of Mint. <hi>Elixir Proprietatis</hi> is an excellent Stomachic, but for acid Crudities, it ought to be prepar'd without an Acid, and mix'd with Spirit of Sal-armoniac. For muſty Crudities let it be prepar'd with an Acid, and mix'd with Spirit of Scurvygraſs. <hi>Mynſichtius</hi> his Elixir of Vitriol; <hi>Michael</hi> s Stomachical Elixir mix'd with the Aſthmatic Spirit, or with the Spirits of Maſtic and Scurvygraſs; Eſſence of Baum mix'd with the Philoſophical Spirit of Vitriol; as likewiſe thoſe of Penny-royal, Mint, Roſemary, Saſſafras and Myrrh, are all very proper. Wormwood-Wine is likewiſe uſeful. Or,</p>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:207638:49"/>
                     <p>Take of curl'd Mind, wild Calamint and Wormwood, of each a handful; Elecampane-roots, Acorus-Roots, of each an Ounce; Galangal, three Drams; Cinnamom, three Drams; Mace, one Dram, ('tis very oyly, and therefore a ſmall Quantity will ſuffice) Anniſeeds three or ſix Drams. Cut, bruiſe, and tie them in a Bag; to be infus'd in Rheniſh Wine in a warm place for twelve Hours. Let the Patient take a Draught of the Infuſion before Eating, adding to every Draught fifteen drops of dulcify'd Spirit of Salt.</p>
                     <p>The Rob of Juniper-Berries with Ginger, Mace and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, may be us'd by way of Electuary.</p>
                     <p>Sal-armoniac given in Wormwood-wine; <hi>Arcanum Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicatum,</hi> or eſſential Salt of Tartar mix'd with Aromatic Powders; the Infuſion of Aron and Elecampane roots in Wine; Chocolat and Thea, are all of excellent uſe.</p>
                     <p>As for muſty Crudities, Vomits, and gentle Purges of Rhubarb and Tamarinds are proper. Then precipitating Earthy Powders follow'd by Acid Juleps. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Arcanum Duplicatum,</hi> two Scruples; prepar'd Cuttle-bone, a Scruple; Powder of Nutmegs, ſix Grains. Mix for two or three Doſes.</p>
                     <p>Take of Mint-water, an Ounce and a half; Cinnamom-Water, two Drams; Juice of Quinces, ſix Drams; Syrup of the Juice of Quinces half a Dram. Mix for a Potion. Dulcify'd Spirit of Salt, Spirit of Maſtic, <hi>Elixir Proprietatis,</hi> Ivory, Coral, Cream of Tartar, Quinces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Ingredients.</p>
                     <p>Acid Crudities are remov'd by abſorbent Powders, and volatil Aromatics, ſuch as Scurvygraſs, leſſer Centory, Wormwood, Rhubarb, and eſpecially Ginger; volatil Spirits of Mint, Sage, Scurvygraſs, that of Sal-armoniac mix'd with Vegetable Spirits, Spirit of Tartar, Hartſhorn, <hi>&amp;c. Elixir Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietatis</hi> prepar'd without an Acid, together with the fixed Salts of Wormwood, <hi>Carduus Benedictus, &amp;c.</hi> the dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtive Hypocondriac Salt, Hartſhorn, Ivory, Crabs-Eyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Above all River-Crabs together with the Shells, are much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd. All Acids muſt be avoided, and after the Acid is vanquiſh'd, Purgatives adminiſtred.</p>
                     <p>Beſides internal Medicines, external Applications are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for promoting Chylification. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Oyl of Mint prepar'd by Infuſion and boyling, two Drams; expreſs'd Oyl of Nutmegs, a Dram; diſtill'd Oyls of Mint, of Mace and of Cloves, of each half a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:207638:49"/>Mix and anoint the Region of the Stomach. Balſam of <hi>Peru</hi> is very proper for the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Take of Tacamahac, three parts; Gum-Caran, one part; ſoften 'em with Balſam of <hi>Peru,</hi> or diſtill'd Oyl of Mint, and make a Plaiſter to be applied to the Stomac.</p>
                     <p>A Spunge dip'd in Wine impregnated with the Vehicle of Stomachic Simples, and applied hot to the Stomac, is alſo much approv'd.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of Wind in the Stomach and Guts.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>WHEN the Work of Chylification is diſturb'd, Wind oft times moleſts and diſtends the Stomach; which if it break upwards with a noiſe is call'd <hi>Belching;</hi> if it be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd both upwards and downwards, 'tis call'd a dry <hi>Cholera.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wind is ſomewhat different from Vapors and Exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, either of which is reſolv'd by heat, and thicken'd by cold; whereas it undergoes no ſuch alteration. Nay, 'tis neither heat nor cold that is directly concern'd in giving it a Being; 'tis only the vicious fermentation of a Preternatural Acid within a thick viſcous Body. Thus we ſee that Spirit of Nitre pour'd upon a Metallin ſoluble Body, boyls up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Wind and Noiſe. The like will happen in the diſtillation of Tartar; or the effuſion of Vinegar or Juice of Citrons upon Corals, or Crabs-Eyes. In like manner Bread or new Wine, if fermented, will riſe up with a windy noiſe; but if fermentation be neglected, no other proceſs of boyling, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerating, diſtilling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is able to produce that effect. And once more; if Apples be expos'd to the Sun, ſo as to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo a fermentation by vertue of the heat, their Skin will chop and break to give way to the Wind, and no other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement whatſoever can compaſs that end.</p>
                     <p>Thus 'tis made to appear that Wind is not pre-exiſtent in the Liquors or Humors themſelves; but newly created by vertue of the impriſonment of acid and urinous Salts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a viſcous Body, which they endeavour to attenuate and break through, when diſſolv'd and put into motion by the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:207638:50"/>addition of a ferment. Now that the Vehicle is viſcid, is ſufficiently made out by the tenacious groſs Humors that are voided upwards by Vomiting.</p>
                     <p>The Part affected is the Cavity of the Stomach, and its upper Orifice. The immediate Cauſe is already explain'd. To which we may add a violent compreſſion which obliges the Wind, in purſuit of a larger ſpace to move in, to break forth and forſake its narrow Habitation; juſt as Air condenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted diſplays its Elaſtic force, and ſeeks to enlarge its Bounds, driving before it the contiguous interfering Bodies with a notable noiſe.</p>
                     <p>The remote Cauſes are the eating of viſcous Food, and retention of acid Crudities. Flatulent Meats may be very apt to encourage a Windy noiſe, but without the fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of an incloſed Acid they cannot of themſelves produce it. Therefore 'tis, that the ſame Meats will occaſion ſuch diſturbances in acid Conſtitutions, that are digeſted by other Perſons without any diſorder.</p>
                     <p>Some flatulent Diſtentions are natural, produc'd by the oyly Bile and acid <hi>Mucus</hi> of the Stomac and Guts, when their Cavities are Empty, and projected by Nature to keep their walls from joyning, and continue the openneſs of their Pores. As to the Differences of Belchings, ſome are Acid, as in Hypocondriac caſes, and after long faſting; ſome mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, of which above; ſome anſwerable to the natural quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Food receiv'd, as thoſe caus'd by eating Onyons, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſome quite inſipid; and laſtly, tho very rarely, ſome are attended by a prodigious ſtink. Now the cauſe of flatulent ſtinks muſt be fetch'd from the Chymical Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of diſſolving fat Sulphureous Subſtances with Alcali's, and precipitating with Acids. As Antimony calcin'd with Nitre and Tartar in the Preparation of <hi>Crocus Metallorum,</hi> then diſſolv'd in Water, and precipitated with Vinegar yields a moſt noyſom Smell; ſo the oyly Salts of the Bile firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd and then precipitated by Acids, are indow'd with the like Quality.</p>
                     <p>The Signs are theſe. If the Wind cannot force its paſſage the Breaſt or Belly is diſtended and perplex'd; if touch'd, it rebounds as it were; the reſpiration is very difficult, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the Perſons lie on their Backs; they are mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with violent Pains, and toſſing from ſide to ſide, they perceive a ſort of flatulent noiſe within; Juſt before the Wind breaks forth, they complain of a vaſt Perplexity in their Breaſts, but when it gains its Paſſage, are benefited by it.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:207638:50"/>Sometimes theſe flatulent Diſtentions reach the Neck and Back, and occaſion a Swelling about the Mouth of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac, which prevents the breaking of Wind downwards, and reaps no advantage by thoſe which paſs upwards. And Eating augments this Diſtention.</p>
                     <p>As for Prognoſtics. They are uſually the Symptoms of a Hypocondriac Illneſs; and if they happen upon the recovery of a Diſeaſe portend its relapſe. If they continue long they threaten Dropſies. If they ſtink horridly, they are very malignant and contagious.</p>
                     <p>The Cure is perform'd by attenuating and diſcharging the viſcid Matter, diſcuſſing the Wind, and moderating its force. In the firſt place let Antimonial Emerics be exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and next to them, the Stomachical Purgatives pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd in the laſt Chapter. After the firſt Paſſages are clear'd the oyly volatil ſalin Simples are equally proper for temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Acid and attenuating the viſcous Humour. As for Example.</p>
                     <p>Take of Fennel and Mint-water, of each an Ounce and a half; Carminative-water prepar'd with Wine, an Ounce; Spirit of Anis, Eſſence of Orange-peel, of each three Drams; diſtill'd Oyl of Mace, five drops; Syrup of Orange-peel, ſix Drams. Make a Potion to be taken by Spoonfuls.</p>
                     <p>Chamomil, with the four hot Seeds both larger and leſſer boyl'd in Wine, or their diſtill'd Oyls, or their Spirits mix'd with that of Sal-armoniac, Caſtor, or its Eſſence prepar'd with Spirit of Sal-armoniac, Myrrh, Treacle, Orange-peel, Amber-griſe, Cinnamom, and all Oyly Volat-Salts, are proper for the ſame purpoſe. As for Example.</p>
                     <p>Take of Coriander-ſeeds, half an Ounce; Anniſeeds, Fennel-ſeeds, of each two Drams; Zedoary, Ginger, Galan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, and Sal-armoniac; of each a Dram; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Balſam of Sulphur is of very good uſe, as likewiſe the aromatic compound Waters of the above mention'd Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; but above all the Carminative Spirit <hi>de Tribus,</hi> that is, the Spirit diſtill'd from Tartar and Nitre; mix'd with Spirit of Wine tartaris'd, and rectify'd.</p>
                     <p>Take of Mint-water, two Ounces; <hi>Roman</hi> Chamomil water, an Ounce; Zedoary-water, half an Ounce; Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minative Spirit <hi>de Tribus,</hi> a Dram and a half; Eſſence of Opium, a Scruple; Syrup of Orange-peel, an Ounce. Mix for a Draught.</p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:207638:51"/>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Elixir proprietatis</hi> prepar'd without Acids, three Drams; Eſſence of Caſtor, two Drams; Eſſence of Opium, a Dram. Mix. Doſe forty drops.</p>
                     <p>If Wind be accompanied with Fluſhings in the Face, and a notable heat, there is nothing comparable to the Spirit of Nitre dulcify'd with Spirit of Wine, and impregnated with the vertue of Carminative-Simples, after <hi>Sylvius</hi>'s Method. <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>'s extemporary mixture is very ſerviceable in this caſe; <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of Fennel and Mint-water, of each two Ounces; rectify'd Spirit of Wine, or <hi>Matthiolus</hi>'s <hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi> or <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>'s Carminative Spirit, an Ounce; Spirit of Nitre, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty drops; diſtill'd Oyl of Mace, ſix drops; <hi>Laudanum Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atum</hi> three Grains; Syrup of Mint, an Ounce and a half. Mix. Doſe two Spoonfuls.</p>
                     <p>As for inveterat acid Belchings five or ſix Pepper-corns ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken every Morning faſting are very uſeful; as likewiſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbent Earthy Powders mix'd with Aromatics; Eſſence or Juice of Wormwood taken at Meals, and the Powder of Coral, Cuttle-bone, and Oſtiocolla, mix'd with Spirit of Wine impregnated with Juniper. If the Wind proceed from a thick ſtubborn Mucilage, exhibit the Aſthmatical Syrup mix'd with a double quantity of <hi>Michael</hi>'s Elixir for the Stomac.</p>
                     <p>Externally let the place affected be fomented with the Oyls of Chamomil, and of the Carminative-ſeeds; or with a mixture of Anis-water, Spirit of Wine camphoris'd, and Treacle; or cover'd with a Plaiſter of Tacamahac, Balſam of <hi>Peru,</hi> and Treacle.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of Vomiting and Loathing of Meat.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>HAVING thus accompany'd the Food from its firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try into the Mouth, till its arrival in the Stomac, we are now to view the Cauſes that diſturb its Repoſe.</p>
                     <p>That Senſe which with reſpect to external parts is call'd <hi>Pain,</hi> is Chriſten'd <hi>Irritation</hi> among the Internal Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes; as the upper Orifice of the Stomach is ſaid to be irritated when any Object grates upon, or diſpleaſes it. Now the natural reſult of Irritation is, that Crowds of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are ſummon'd in by the angry part, and upon their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival it contracts it ſelf. Thus the Mouth of the Stomac being extremely ſenſible, contracts it ſelf upon the leaſt Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritation, the natural conſequence of which is a loathing of Meat, or denying admiſſion to it when ſwallow'd; or, if it happen to force its paſſage, the impriſon'd Wind belches out at the new open'd Gate. But if this contraction be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd to the <hi>Pylorus,</hi> or lower Orifice of the Stomac, its Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres being ſtronger than thoſe of the upper, throw up the Contents, with force ſufficient to maſter the Paſſage, and hence inſues a direct Vomiting. So that Loathing and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting differ in this point, That the one is a contraction of the upper, the other of the lower Orifice of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac.</p>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:207638:52"/>
                     <p>Vomiting is ſaid to be Eſſential, when the Irritating cauſe is lodg'd within the Stomach. Such Cauſes are, a Wound, Inflammation, Ulcer, Gangren, or Schirrus of the Stomac or Pylorus; ſharp Scorbutic Salts convey'd thither in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with the Spittle, or depoſited by the Arteries; the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious efferveſcency or recoyling of the Gall and Pancreatic Juice; clotted Blood, corrupt Matter, or any Humor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodg'd of its proper Habitation, and hurry'd into the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac; the Aſſumption of ſharp Irritating Medicines, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, Purges, Poyſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or of fat things (which relaxat the Fibres of the upper Orifice, and ſtruggle with the acid ferment;) Crudities, Worms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Cauſe be ſeated elſewhere, the Vomiting is caus'd by conſent, by reaſon either of the Stomac's being one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd piece with the affected part; or of their mutual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce maintain'd by the Nerves. Thus the Diſorders of the Bowels, Guts, Midriff, Head, Kidneys, Womb, Liver and Spleen, are frequently the cauſes of Vomiting. A Schirrus or corruption of the Sweetbread, ſtagnation of the Seminal Juice in Widows and ſtale Maids, and in a word whatever diſturbs or inflames the Animal Spirits, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the ſame effect.</p>
                     <p>Vomiting is uſher'd in by Anxiety and Trouble in the Breaſt, Swiming of the Head, trembling of the Under-Lip, plentiful evacuations of Spittle, and Convulſive Motions of the Stomac. An Eſſential Vomiting ought to be carefully diſtinguiſh'd from that which is Sympathical. If, when the Stomac is empty'd by Vomiting, there remains ſtill a propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to Vomit; if the Stomac continue heavy and blown up, and nauſeat Food; if acid or muſty Belchings inſue, we take it for an eſſential Vomiting. If it be incorrigible and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat, uſher'd in at firſt by a pain in the Breaſt, and after a Day or two a Loathing; in a word, if no fault can be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten'd on the contain'd Humours, it proceeds from a Callo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, Schirrus, or ſuch like default in the Stomac. If it come in a ſurprizing manner without the precedent Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ns of Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the Breaſt, Loathing, weak Stomac, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'Tis a ſhrewd Argument that it proceeds by conſent from the diſorder of ſome other part, that is not yet come to light.</p>
                     <p>If it be caus'd by a viſcid Humor, 'tis hard to cure it. If the Chyle and Food be frequently thrown up, with a feaver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh heat, 'tis an ill circumſtance. Long and continual Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting in Malignant Feavers, eſpecially if the Matter be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, blackiſh, or fetid, is very dangerous. In benign Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:207638:52"/>vomiting in the beginning, or height, is good. If it follow Wounds or Bruiſes of the Head, 'tis frequently mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. The Periodical Vomitings of Hypochondriac, Scorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, and Splenetic Perſons, are of a good Character. If the Matter vomited, be a mixture of Choler and Pituita, 'tis a Friendly Symptom, but either of them apart is more noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. The vomiting of Worms, Excrements of the Belly, Clyſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is much ſuſpected.</p>
                     <p>Before we launch into the method of Cure, 'twill not be improper to take Notice of the following Cautions: 1. That Critical Vomits, or thoſe which happen in the beginning of Benign Diſeaſes, or thoſe of Women with Child in their firſt Months, ought not to be ſtopp'd, unleſs they exceed mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. 2. That in Scorbutic Caſes, abſorbent mitigating In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients are more proper than hot, ſharp Aromatics. 3. That a Vomiting of Blood ought to be curb'd betimes, for fear of exhauſting the Spirits. 4. In caſe of Worms, it ought to be incourag'd, and the Body kept ſoluble. 5. That in all Vomitings 'tis convenient to keep the belly open by gentle Purges and Clyſters: But withal, the quantity of the Liquor for Clyſters muſt be ſmall, leſt the Colon being diſtended, it ſhould preſs, or irritate the incumbent bottom of the Stomac. 6. By all means let Sleep be promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. 7. All Vomitings occaſion'd by aſſumption of Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ought to be encourag'd and continu'd till the Poyſon be rooted out: For which end fat and tempering Liquors are very Proper; for that all Vegetable and Mineral Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are endu'd with an exceſſive Acrimony. As touching Animal Poyſons, indeed the caſe is alter'd. 8. That Inap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency, Loathing, and ſuch like Infirmities of the Stomac, ought to be obviated betimes by Vomits, leſt delay remove the opportunity.</p>
                     <p>The General Indications of Cure are theſe. The Remote Cauſes muſt be remov'd; the exquiſite ſenſe of the Stomac and fierceneſs of the Spirits abated by Opiats; the Stomac gratify'd with agreeable Aromatics, and fortify'd by Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Indication muſt be ſatisfied according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of the Cauſes. Gentle Vomits and Purges are conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, if vicious Humors in the Stomach, or Poyſon, are blam'd as the Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>For the ſecond Indication <hi>Laudanum Opiatum</hi> is an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable and univerſal Remedy. Mithridat, <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle, and eſpecially <hi>Diaſcordium,</hi> are entitled to the ſame Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter. As for Example,</p>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:207638:53"/>
                     <p>Take of Treacle half a Dram, <hi>Laudanum Opiatum</hi> a Grain, diſtill'd Oyl of Mace two Drops, with Juice of Quinces make a <hi>Bolus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third Indication is anſwer'd by ſweet-ſcented, Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic, Stomachic Remedies. Such as are Quinces, Mint, Wormwood, Baum, Zedoary, Orange Peel, Maſtic, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phir, Cloves, Nutmegs, and eſpecially Cinamom; their Waters, Spirits, Eſſences, Extracts and diſtill'd Oyls. The Aſtringent Ingredients are <hi>Quercetanus</hi>'s Syrup of Coral, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of dry Roſes, Juice of Pomgranats, Vinegar with Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doary infus'd, <hi>Elixir</hi> of Vitriol, and eſpecially the Spirit of Vitriol of Steel, and [Juice of Quinces. Seal'd Earth beat into a Pultiſe, with Spirit of Vitriol, or of Nitre, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens into a Stone; which if powder'd and put into a moiſt place, melts into a Styptic Liquor, of admirable uſe for all Aſtringent Indications.</p>
                     <p>Take of Mint-Water two or three Ounces, Cinnamom-Water ſix Drams, Juice of Quinces an Ounce, rectify'd Spirit of Vitriol five or ſix Drops, Diſtill'd Oyl of Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mom three Drops, mix. Take a ſpoonful now and then, adding ſometimes one, two or three Grains of <hi>Laudanum O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatum:</hi> or if the Perſon be very weak, a Scruple of the Eſſence of Ambergriſe; or in a caſe of Extremity, four or five Grains of Allum.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle mixt with Vinegar, or form'd into a <hi>Bolus,</hi> with Spirit of Vitriol, is much approv'd. In malignant Feavers Salt of Wormwood, with Juice of Limons; when the Stomach is ſtuff'd with thick Humors, Spirit of Salt, or of Nitre with Treacle; and when the Stomach is inflam'd, or corroded, the Muci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>age of Fleawort and Quince-ſeeds, with ſolutive Syrup of Roſes, are very convenient.</p>
                     <p>Externally, Let Aromatic and Corroborating Ingredients be boyl'd in Vinegar, and the warm Decoction applied with a Spunge to the Stomach; or let toaſted bread, ſoak'd in Vinegar, and cover'd with Aromatic Pouders, be applied to the Region of the Stomach. Spirit of Wine Campho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris'd, is very effectual in Fomentations. A Bag may be quilted with Mint, Nutmegs, Cloves, Mace and Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mom, ſprinkl'd with Triacl'd Spirit of Wine, and Diſtill'd Oyl of Mint, and applied. Some commend the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a bag of Saffron.</p>
                     <p>Liniments are compos'd of <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle, Balſam of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru,</hi> or Oyls of Maſtic, Wormwood, Quinces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:207638:53"/>
                     <p>Take of Expreſs'd Oyl of Nutmegs two Drams, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd Oyls of Mint, Cloves and Mace of each half a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Diſtill'd Oyl of Cinnamom five Drops, make a Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and anoint the Stomach and Breaſt. Plaiſters may be made of Tacamahac and Gum Caran, with Aromatic Oyls, after the Example of <hi>Crato</hi>'s. Cataplaſms are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe proper, as,</p>
                     <p>Take of the ſharpeſt Yeſt four Ounces, Pouder of Mint an Ounce, of Zedoary ſix Drams, Nutmegs three in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Mace, Cloves and Cinnamom of each two Drams, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſeeds, Cuminſeeds and Fennelſeeds of each three Drams. With a little vinegar of Roſes make a Cataplaſm to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Stomach.</p>
                     <p>When the Irritating Cauſe is transfer'd from other parts to the Stomach, Purging, Bleeding, and ſuch like Diverſions are very proper. As Women with Child are ſometimes cur'd of vomiting by Blood-letting. When we are oblig'd to ſtop an Artificial vomiting, 'tis convenient to exhibit Milk boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Bread, or Bread ſoak'd in Generous Wine; Inject Clyſters of Milk with Treacle; adminiſter Opiats, and apply outwardly as above.</p>
                     <p>If the Aſſumption of an harſh Purge diſpoſe one to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, there's nothing better than to chew freſh Citron Peel, or ſmell to toaſted Bread dipp'd in vinegar, and cover it with Pouder of Cloves.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of a Vomiting of Blood.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THis Symptom may be caus'd by the ſuppreſſion of the Piles or Terms in Maids or Women with Child: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of a Vein or Artery; as that of the <hi>Vas breve,</hi> thro the Obſtruction of the Spleen, which emptys its Blood into the Stomac; or any of the Pancreatic Veins, occaſion'd by the ſharpneſs of its Juice, which Veins depoſit their Blood into the Duodenum, and then it is voided both upwards and downwards. Sometimes the healing up of a ſordid Ulcer may occaſion it, by reaſon partly that the Blood was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:207638:54"/>evacuated in the form of corrupt Matter, and partly that the Ferment of the Ulcer may have corroded the Veſſels in the Lungs. It ſucceeds frequently to Amputations, the Blood being then crouded into Fewer Channels.</p>
                     <p>The Signs are theſe. Arterious Blood is fluid and reddiſh. If the vomited matter be of an obſcure colour, and clot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, reſembling the Liver, it comes from the Veins. If it incline to a black colour, be voided with a biting pain, and tended by an auſtere taſte, 'tis not Blood, but an acid cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt humor, or <hi>Atra Bilis.</hi> If it proceed from the rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Vas breve,</hi> 'tis uſher'd in by a beating pain in the left ſide of the Back, under the ſhort Ribs.</p>
                     <p>The Vomiting of <hi>Atra Bilis</hi> is fatal, as likewiſe a Void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Blood any way in the Small Pox, Meaſles, or other Eruptions. If the Piles ſucceed to Vomiting, 'tis a good ſign; as alſo if it come by Intervals in Splenetic and Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Diſeaſes. If it be Critical, all is well.</p>
                     <p>The Cure conſiſts in removing the Cauſes, diverting the Blood from the Stomac, fortifying the broken Veſſel, atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating and throwing off what is already extravaſated. Blood-letting in the Arm or Leg, or opening the Hemorr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoid Veſſels, muſt be premiſed in Caſes of <hi>Ploethora</hi>'s, or Suppreſſions of Blood. As for Aſtringents, the Syrup of the Juice of Comfrey Roots and Plantane Leaves (not cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify'd) mix'd with Sugar, is recommended by the Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> and mightily eſteem'd in <hi>England.</hi> Water of Nettles, mix'd with Spirit of Vitriol, is extoll'd by <hi>Hartman</hi> and ſeveral other Authors. Or,</p>

                     <p>Take a convenient quantity of the Earth of Vitriol of Steel, well calcin'd and dulcify'd, diſſolve it in Spirit of Salt, draw off the Spirit in a Fire of Sand till the reſidue come to the conſiſtence of Honey. Upon which digeſt Rectify'd Spirit of Wine for ſome time, and ſtrain the Tincture for uſe.</p>
                     <p>Take of Plantane and Tormentil-water of each an Ounce, innamom-water and Vinegar of each ſix Drams, Prepared Red Coral half a Dram, Troches of Amber a Dram, ſeal'd Earch half a Dram, Mummy ſix Grains,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:207638:54"/>
                        <hi>Laudanum Opiatum</hi> one Grain, Syrup of Comfrey one Ounce Make a Potion.</p>
                     <p>If the Breaſt be perplex'd, the Pulſe weak, Reſpiration difficult, the Stomac blown up, the Face Pale, and liable to ſudden Fluſhings, and the Perſon apt to ſwoon, 'tis a ſign that the Blood is congeal'd in the Stomac. In which caſe Crabs Eyes, Coral and Diaphoretic Antimony, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially <hi>Sperma Coeti,</hi> are proper. After the ſtagnating Blood is attenuated, the remaining Clots may be carried off by Rhubarb, or a Gentle Vomit.

                  <head>SECT. VII. <hi>Of Pains of the Stomac.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>SOmetimes the Breaſt, or the whole Cavity reaching from the Mouth of the Stomac to the Midriff, Liver, Spleen and Sweet-bread, is ſiez'd with a Prodigious Uneaſineſs and Confus'd Pain cauſing the afflicted Perſon to toſs up and down the Bed. This we call <hi>Anxiety.</hi> If this Pain be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly fix'd to the Pit of the Breaſt, attended by a ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Compreſſion, with a ſenſe of Biting and Gnawing, 'tis call'd <hi>Cardialgia,</hi> or Pain in the Stomac. The former is wandring, ariſing from the leaſt irritation, and is fitly reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by the Anxiety following the Aſſumption of a Vomit. The latter is fix'd, ariſing from a Convulſive Contraction, and is of the ſame Nature as the Pain we are afflicted with, when we ſwallow any thing too hard or overbulky.</p>
                  <p>All Anxieties, excepting ſuch as ariſe from Suffocation, or the diſturbance of reſpiration, are owing to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction or uneaſineſs of the upper and more ſenſible Orifice of the Stomac, as appears by their following the aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Vomit, attending Hyſteric Conſtitutions, and being abated by Belching; their Accompanying Agues, and Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing after Vomiting, and their being caus'd by Eating of heavy Suppers. The blame is uſually caſt upon the Heart, but very unjuſtly; for the Heart is an indolent muſcle; and if it be irritated, is ſiez'd with Convulſions, or what we call a Palpitation; which does not Accompany Anxieties of the Breaſt.</p>
                  <p>The Remote cauſes are, ſharp Poyſonous things taken into the Stomac, Corrupt Food, Wind, Vicious Humors, or Foreign ferments Tranſlated thither, Inflammations and ſuch like diſorders of its Membrans, Convulſions of the Nerves or Adjacent Parts, and in a Word, whatever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes the Mouth of the Stomac to Contract it ſelf.</p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:207638:55"/>
                  <p>Anxieties are uſually Companions to other Diſeaſes, whoſe peculiar cure muſt be taken care of. In General Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic, Diſcuſſing Ingredients together with Vitriol, and Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Medicines are very proper.</p>
                  <p>The Pain of the ſtomac was by the Ancients call'd <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dialgia,</hi> by reaſon of the frequent Swoonings, Proſtration of ſtrength, and Cold ſweats that attend it; tho in the mean while the Heart is not at all afflicted. The left Orifice of the Stomac is its ſeat, as being the moſt ſenſible tender Part of the whole Body, richly ſtor'd with Nerves, that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a near Corr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſpondence with all the Nervous ſyſteme. This Pain is caus'd by the Preternatural fermentation of the Bile and other vicious Juices; 'tis attended by Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations; ſometimes 'tis ſeated in the back of the ſtomac, and ſometimes glides along the Gullet to the very ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or reſembles the Compreſſion or Squeezing of the Throat.</p>
                  <p>The remote cauſes are whatever offends the left Orifice of the ſtomac, or provokes it to Contraction. Nephritic Pains, Contorſions of the Backbone, Depreſſion of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilago Enſiformis,</hi> Stones in the Gall Bladder, or Duode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, Tumors in the Meſentery and Sweetbread, Hyſteric Paſſions, and Suppreſſion of the terms, may occaſion it by conſent. The Boyling of the Juices in the firſt Paſſages, In Intermitting feavers, frequently produces this ſymptom, which is remov'd by Clyſters. Wind in an empty ſtomac, an Acid viſcid matter gnawing and piercing the upper Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, (which generally quickens about an hour or two after Eating) Green or Ruſty Bile Tinctur'd with a Corroſive acid from the Sweetbread, Corruption or Acidity of the Victuals; Tumors, Stones, or Ulcers in the ſtomac; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of ſublimat Mercury, Arſenic; Coagulation of Milk, or new Cheeſe in the ſtomac occaſion'd by its mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with an Acid, Worms in the ſtomac, ſwallowing of Leeches (cur'd by ſalt Water) pieces of Glaſs, Pins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Are frequently the Authors of the ſame diſorder. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is Periodical, according to the ſucceſſive return of its cauſes.</p>
                  <p>The Symptoms of Anxiety, and Pain of the Stomac are, an Inexpreſſible ſort of uneaſineſs about the Pit of the Breaſt, unquietneſs, toſſing, difficult Reſpiration and Swooning, uſher'd in by Giddineſs, and follow'd by cold Sweats and a pale Chilneſs in the Outward Parts. If the Pain ſeize the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Stomac, it ought to be carefully diſtinguiſh'd
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:207638:56"/>from the Cholic, by obſerving if it creeps upwards, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends to the Loyns and Kidnies; If it accompanies other Diſeaſes, or comes by it ſelf; the former are ſigns of a Pain in the Stomac, the latter of the Cholic.</p>
                  <p>If Anxiety and Pain of the Stomac proceed from Worms or Wind, it is not very dangerous, tho the Symptoms may ſeem diſmal. To children it prognoſticates Epilepſies, and to Adult Perſons Chronical Diſeaſes. If it ariſe from curd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Milk, or a green, ruſty, ſharp, viſcous humour, 'tis dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. If it owe its being to a Viſcous, Pituitous Matter, 'tis not ſo violent. If follow'd by Convulſions, 'tis much ſuſpected; as alſo if it accompany Acute Feavers.</p>
                  <p>The cure is perform'd by removing the offending cauſe, and abating the Pain. If it depend upon another Diſeaſe, it yeilds to its cure. If it be Eſſential, or accompany Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, there's nothing equals Antimonial Vomits, which prevent an Infinity of diſmal circumſtances. After Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Purges are proper. But by reaſon of their offenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Stomae, let 'em be mix'd with Opiats; a uſeful contrivance fot ſuch as are liable to Gripings, or over-purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; or ſtuff'd with ſharp, Scorbutic, Hypocondriac Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors.</p>
                  <p>Take of Tartar vitriolated fifteen Grains, Scammony ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurated two or three Grains, <hi>Laudanum Opiatum</hi> one or two Grains, Extract of Troches <hi>Alhandal</hi> one Grain, Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Oyl of Caraways two Drops. Make a Pouder.</p>
                  <p>Take of <hi>Quercetanus</hi>'s Pills of Ammoniac twelve Grains, Magiſtery of Jalap five Grains, Scammony ſulphurated, and <hi>Laudanum Opiatum</hi> of each a Grain; with Eſſence of <hi>Caſtor</hi> make Pills. Four or five Grains of Fulminatory Gold may be added.</p>
                  <p>Take of Aloes half an Ounce, Myrrh two Drams, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtic a Dram, Oriental Saffron half a Dram, Rectify'd Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Antimony a Dram; with ſolutive Syrup of Roſes make a Maſs. Doſe from fifteen to twenty four Grains. This is the compoſition of <hi>Poterius</hi> his Catholic Pills.</p>
                  <p>If it be caus'd by Wind, or the Steams of the Choler and Pancreatic Juice fermenting in the <hi>Duodenum,</hi> let Carmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native Clyſters be injected; As,</p>
                  <p>Take of Leaves of Mint, Wild Marjoram, and Penny Royal, of each a handful; Chamomil Flowers, half a handful; Angelica Roots half an Ounce; Bayberries three Drams. Seeds of Anis, Carrets, and Fennel, of each a Dram. Boyl them in Water and Man's Urine. To Eight
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:207638:56"/>or Nine Ounces of the ſtrain'd Liquor add of Lenitive Electu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary and Electuary of Bayberries four or ſix Drams, Diſtill'd Oyls of Anniſeeds, and Fennelſeeds of each half a Scruple, Yelks of Eggs, in number one. Make a Clyſter to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected warm. 'Tis proper to add Salt of Tartar, by reaſon that at once it whets the Clyſter, and attenuats the viſcid humors.</p>
                  <p>Blood-letting is inconvenient, excepting the caſe of a <hi>Plae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thora,</hi> or ſome notable ſuppreſſion of Blood.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Indication is ſatisfied by Opiats, as thus: Take of Chamomil water three Ounces, Cinnamom-water one Ounce, <hi>Elixir</hi> of Mint, or of Citrons, or of Oranges, ſix Drams, Diſtill'd Oyl of Chamomil ſix Drops, <hi>Laudanum Opiatum</hi> from three to ſix Grains, Syrup of Hyſop ſix Drams, Syrup of Canel an Ounce. Mix them. Doſe two or three ſpoonfuls. 'Tis a Catholic Mixture for all Pains of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac. The Spirits of Salarmoniac, Anniſeeds, Hartſhorn, Tincture of Tartar, Carminative Spirit <hi>de tribus,</hi> or, if the Pain be attended by a burning heat, dulcify'd Spirit of Nitre, may be conveniently added.</p>
                  <p>The Remaining Specifics are vary'd according to the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. If Wind be deem'd for the Cauſe, Chamomil is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Specific, by reaſon of its Anodyn and Aromatic Vertues. Its Water, its Eſſence extracted with a Carminative Spirit of Wine, its Decoction, its Oyl drunk with Wine, or applied outwardly with Oyl of Nutmegs, are all of excellent vſe. Next are the Decoctions of Saſſafras, Hyſſop, Dill, Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary and Mullein Flowers; The Tincture and Diſtill'd Oyl of Orange or Citron Peel, Spirit and Diſtill'd Oyl of Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeds, Spirit of Salarmoniac, <hi>Elixir</hi> of Mint, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If it be attended by a Notable Heat, to theſe Aromatic Ingredients we may add Acids, as the Juices and Syrups of Quinces, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons and Pomegranats, Spirit of Nitre dulcify'd with a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple quantity of the Spirit of Anniſeeds.</p>
                  <p>If the Anxiety or Pain proceed from Acid ſharp Humors, or green ruſty Choler, Abſorbent Pouders are proper; as, Take of Prepar'd Red Coral, Cinnabar of Antimony, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeat Diaphoretic Antimony, of each Eight Grains, <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum Opiatum</hi> a Grain, Diſtill'd Oyl of Cloves one Drop, Make a Pouder to be exhibited in Chamomil-water, mix'd with Eſſence of Caſtor.</p>
                  <p>If it ariſe from a Viſcous Mucilage, Cream of Tartar and Gum Ammoniac are proper Ingredients. If it be caus'd by Sublimat Mercury, let Milk mix'd with Oyl of Sweet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:207638:57"/>or Oyl of Tartar, <hi>per deliquium,</hi> be exhibited: Let Prepar'd Chryſtal, <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle and Freſh Butter, be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd in Barley-water, and given to drink; and the Stomac fomented with the Decoction of Henbane Leaves in Red Wine. Some recommend ſeal'd Earth, with Syrup of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey for internal uſe. Pins, Pieces of Glaſs, and ſuch like ſharp things ſwallow'd, and pricking the Stomac, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd by drinking Oyl of Sweet Almonds and Broth; or eating a thick Pultiſe of Rice and Milletſeeds.</p>
                  <p>If the Pain be occaſion'd by Worms, give <hi>Elixir Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis</hi> without the Acid, and Spirit of Sal Armoniac, or Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taris'd Eſſence of Wormwood. As for Old Perſons, who are frequently troubled with a Pain of the Stomac, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a notable Weakneſs, and Propenſity to ſwoon, the following Pills are of wonderful Efficacy; <hi>Viz.</hi> Take of Ambergriſe two or three Grains, Moſch and Oriental Saffron of each a Grain or two, <hi>Opium</hi> four Grains. Make Pills.</p>
                  <p>As touching External Applications, Ointments are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd after this manner: <hi>Viz.</hi> Take of the Diſtill'd Oyl of Chamomil a Dram, Oyls of Mace and of Cloves of each fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Drops, Balſam of <hi>Peru</hi> half a Dram. With Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Oyl of Nutmegs make a Liniment, and anoint the Breaſt and Stomac, applying afterwards a hot Brick.</p>
                  <p>Plaiſters are very uſeful, eſpecially ſuch as are made of Tacamahac, or Gum Caran, with <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle, or Balſam of <hi>Peru,</hi> and Diſtill'd Oyl of Amber. The Stomac may be likewiſe fomented with the Decoction of Wormwood, Mint, Hyſſop, Marjoram, Chamomil Flowers, Fennel ſeeds and Juniper Berries, in Wine, or Vinegar and Water; or a Bag quilted with the ſame Ingredients and Spices, and ſprinkled with the Oyls of Amber and Mint, may be applied hot to the Stomac.</p>
                  <p>Anodyn Cataplaſms are alſo very uſeful, eſpecially in Scorbutic Caſes; as, Take of the Leaves of Henbane and Mallows, roaſted under Aſhes, of each three Ounces, Meal of Barly and Vetches, reduc'd to a due conſiſtence, with the Decoction of Vetches, of each two ounces; the Mucilages of Tragacanth, of Fleawortſeeds and of Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of each two ounces. Make a Cataplaſm.</p>
                  <p>Womens Pains of the Stomac ariſing from the Faults of the Matrix, are frequently cur'd by the application of <hi>Poma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> and Goats Tallow. As thoſe which proceed from Wind by applying a Bag of Bran, toſted Milletſeeds and common Salt.</p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:207638:57"/>
                  <p>The Diſeaſe which we call the Heat of the Stomac, is near akin to thoſe laſt deſcrib'd. 'Tis ſeated in the Left Orifice of the Stomac, and is only a ſenſe of Heat and Sulphureous Fumes paſſing thro the Gullet, caus'd by the Fermentation of an Acid, with a Fat Oyly Alkali in the Stomac. The Remote Cauſes are over-acid, or over-fat Victuals, Choler abounding in the Stomac, or forc'd thither by Anger, or ſuch like occaſions, or an Hypocondriac Acidity prevailing in the Stomac.</p>
                  <p>The Burning, or Heat, is frequently accompany'd by bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and muſty Belchings; and if it come without a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Cauſe, portends a Chronical Diſtemper. The Specifics that compaſs its Cure are Abſorbent Pouders, ſuch as Chalk, and Cream of Tartar, the Pouder of Burnt Bricks, Bole Armenic, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nutmegs are poſſeſs'd of a temperat Oyl, fit for moderating the Acrimony of the Humours. The Conſerve of the Fruit of the common Briar, Syrup and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of Oak-Buds, Juice of Houſe-leek and Nitre diſſolv'd in Elder-flower-water, are much approv'd.</p>
                  <p>Take of Prepared Chalk two Drams, Nutmegs, burnt I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory, of each a Dram; Mineral Unicorn, Red Coral and Crabs Eyes, of each two Scruples. With four or ſix Ounces of Sugar diſſolv'd in Purſlain-water make Tablets.</p>
                  <p>Take of the Conſerve of Oak-Buds an Ounce, Prepared Chalk two Drams, Nutmegs one Dram. Make an Electuary.</p>
                  <p>If the Evacuations be needful, Tamarinds are moſt proper. When a ſtronger Purgation is deſir'd, Rhubarb, Pills of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac and <hi>Elixir Proprietatis,</hi> are likewiſe convenient. In an Inveterat caſe, we have recourſe to Vomits.</p>

                  <head>SECT. VIII. <hi>Of Diſorders hindring the due Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the Chyle from the Excrements in the Guts.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE Victuals having made a ſufficient ſtay in the Stomac, repair to the Guts, under the form of Chyle; which wants to be further prepar'd by being rid of its Curd, or groſs Excrements, before it enter the <hi>Vaſa Lactea.</hi> This ſeparation of the good and bad is perform'd by the Gall, and Pancreatic Juice. The former is an Oyly ſulphureous Body, which tinctures the Chyle, and prediſpoſes it for being converted into Blood. It defends it from Corruption, deſtroys any remains of Acidity, and ferments with the Pancreatic Juice, which is a temperat Acid. Thus they joyntly attack the Chyle, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuat its parts, and precipitat the Coarſer in order to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, while the more refin'd are receiv'd by the Milky Veſſels, and convey'd to the Blood.</p>
                  <p>If this fermentation and ſeparation be irregularly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, the Body is expos'd to an infinity of Diſeaſes. In a word, all Chronical Diſtempers are owing to the lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this performance, and that of the firſt Digeſtion. From theſe two Juices, <hi>viz.</hi> the Gall, and Pancreatic Juice, together with the Pituita, compos'd of the Saliva and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of the Chyle in the Stomac, <hi>Sylvius</hi> fetch'd the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of a great many Diſeaſes; not only Agues, but all Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Diſtempers, and Symptoms of the lower Belly. For the leaſt diſorder in that Triumvirat, obſtructs the due pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification and conveyance of the Chyle, which cannot but produce many Inconveniencies in the Body.</p>
                  <p>Now each of theſe Juices is accountable for its own faults. If the Gall be too copious, it renders the Chyle
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:207638:58"/>too Oyly, and ought to be purg'd out. If too ſharp, or ſaline, it ought to be temper'd by dulcify'd Acids. If too fat or oyly, it ought to be ſharpen'd with volatil Aromatic Salts. If it be lazy, or do not flow into the Duodenum, it ought to be ſtir'd up, and a paſſage open'd to it by ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous volatil Medicines. As for the Juice of the Sweet-bread, if it be too rank, it ought to be carry'd off. If too acid, or auſtere (its auſterity cauſes Conſtipation of the Belly, Gripings, and Suffocations of the Womb) it ought to be temper'd by Alcali's, both fix'd and volatil; as fix'd Salts, Earths, Chalybeat and Antimonial Medicines, Caſtor, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>langal, Ginger, diſtill'd aromatic Oyls and Spirits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If it be too flat or deficient, it ought to be retriev'd by dulci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd mineral acid Spirits, Juice of Quinces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If the Chyle it ſelf be deprav'd in the firſt Digeſtion, its ſofter coarſe parts that ſtick to the Guts, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>mucus</hi> that defends them from the ſharpneſs of theſe two Juices, is likewiſe diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, and ought to be put to rights. If it be too copious, purge it off with Coloquintida. If too viſcid, atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuat it with volatil Salts; if deficient, repair it with viſcous Food. But for ſo much at 'tis a difficult Task to trace the peculiar faults of every Juice apart, we ſhall touch at ſuch Medicines as are equally calculated for redreſſing all their Diſorders. Thoſe are the temperat ſalin Ingredients, as <hi>Arcanum Duplicatum,</hi> the Carminative Spirit; Spirit of Nitre dulcify'd with a triple quantity of the Spirit of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeds, together with Opiats: As for Example,</p>
                  <p>Take of Carduus Benedictus, Endive and Mint Waters, of each an Ounce; Sal Armoniac, ſix drams; dulcify'd Spirit of Mint, a ſcruple; prepar'd Crabs Eyes, a dram; Diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retic Antimony, a ſcruple; Laudanum Opiatum, three grains; Syrup of Orange-peel, half an ounce.

                  <p>THE Chyle having drop'd its Excrements in the Guts, purſues its Journey to the Blood. Theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements ought to be voided in due time. The hindrances of their regular Evacuation, are ſuch as either impair, enlarge, or deprave it.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>THE Cauſes of Coſtiveneſs reſpect either the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or the Guts. Of the former ſort are the pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Excrements for want of Victuals: Their hardneſs and dryneſs occaſion'd by neglect of drinking, exceſſive ſleep and reſt; ſwallowing Cherry-ſtones, or Gooſeberry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins; eating Cheſnuts, Eggs boyl'd hard, Cruſt of Bread, and Medlars: Their viſcidity and glutinoſity, caus'd by viſcous Victuals, or an acid, auſtere Conſtitution of Body, and want of Exerciſe: Their Condenſation and Coagulation caus'd by the auſtere acidity of the Pancreatic Juice, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:207638:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>defect of the oyly bilious Alcali; all which makes 'em un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for obſerving the Periſtaltic Motion of the Guts, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe 'em to ſtagnat.</p>
                        <p>The Cauſes relating to the Guts, are Obſtructions, or fleſhy Excreſcences in the Guts; their Compreſſion, as in Women with Child; their Inflammation or Gangrene; their growing together after the Corroſion of a Dyſentery; the Paralytic Relaxation of their Fibres, which in Apoplexies eludes Clyſters; Their Convulſive Contractions, occaſion'd by Colic or Nephritic Pains, which are frequently augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſtrong irritating Purgatives, but remov'd by ſmooth Laxatives. Now all theſe Cauſes hinder the Guts to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their wonted Office, of forwarding the Excrements by their Periſtaltic Motion.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes a <hi>Coſtiveneſs</hi> is follow'd by a loathing, vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, gnawing, ſhooting Pains in the Belly, uneaſineſs, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, giddineſs, and Head-ach. If it be inveterat it may occaſion a bleeding at Noſe. If the Excrements be lodg'd in the Colon, they creat an uneaſineſs, reſembling the ſple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netic Illneſs, which frequently impoſes upon Phyſitians. The diſorders of the Head, and Hypocondriac Symptoms are inlarg'd by Coſtiveneſs, which to young Perſons threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten an Epilepſie. If attended by an Iliac Paſſion, Colic Pains, or a Palſie of the Guts, 'tis very dangerous. To Childbearing Women it renders Delivery difficult.</p>
                        <p>The Cure conſiſts in ſoftening, watering, and attenuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Excrements; or in removing the Cauſes which ſtraiten the Capacity of the Guts, reviving their Senſe, and appeaſing their Irritations.</p>
                        <p>For the former purpoſes, Oyl of ſweet Almonds, with ſolutive Syrup of Roſes, Salt of the tendrels of Vines mix'd with Spirit of Salt, ſoft potch'd Eggs with Butter, drinking liberally, and eſpecially Raiſins, are of good uſe; Rhubarb and Aloes are not to be us'd, unleſs mix'd with Antimonial Ingredients.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Pulps of Raiſins, and Tamarinds, of each an ounce and a half; Cryſtals of Tartar, three drams; Powder of Jalap roots, two drams; Scammony ſulphura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, a ſcruple; laxative Antimony, half a dram. With ſolutive Syrup of Roſes, make an Electuary. The Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Prunes, or of Senna, with Raiſins, is likewiſe very effectual. Clarify'd Whey, mix'd with ſolutive Syrup of Roſes, or impregnated with Tamarinds by Decoction, is an incomparable Medicine for opening the Belly. It injoys a
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:207638:60"/>volatil oyly Alcali, which tempers the auſtere acidity of the Juice of the Pancreas (the frequent cauſe of Coſtiveneſs) and moderates the acrimony of ſcorbutic Salts.</p>
                        <p>The Decoctions of emollient Herbs in Broth, or that of Figs in Barly-water, are likewiſe uſeful. Some inſtead of Sugar uſe Manna for the Conferves of Roſes, and Violets, and mix 'em with the Pulp of Raiſins and Cream of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, with very good Succeſs.</p>
                        <p>If the Excrements be very hard, and a glaſſy <hi>Pituita</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet the Guts, there's nothing better than Gum Ammoniac. As, take of Mint-water, an ounce; Gum Ammoniac diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd in Vinegar, a dram; ſolutive Syrup of Roſes, half an ounce; make a Potion for two Doſes. If the Operation be difficult, add Tartar vitriolated, and Scammony ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
                        <p>The Tincture, or Eſſential Salt of Tartar is much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd. But in Caſes of Extremity, we muſt have recourſe to Quickſilver; two or three ounces of which may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in Broth, or Oyl of ſweet Almonds; or it may be infus'd for a Month in Wine, ſhaking the Wine often, of which a ſpoonful or two is a Doſe. Fulminatory Gold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to Pills with Extract of Hellebor, or Syrup of Roſes, is look'd upon by ſome as the laſt Refuge. But it ought not to be dulcify'd or rob'd of its Salt, otherwiſe it becomes diaphoretic. I chooſe to joyn it with Antimonial Nitre, which provokes the Guts to Expulſion; and find it very uſeful both in this caſe, and that of Childrens Gripings. Strong Purgatives ought to be avoided, by reaſon that they promote the Contraction of the Guts, and conſequently the induration of the Excrements.</p>
                        <p>As for External Aſſiſtance; Emollient Clyſters of the Decoctions of ſoftning Herbs, mixt with Lenitive Electua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Hony, Manna, yelks of Eggs, and ſoftning Oyls, are very proper. Some chooſe to inject the Decoction of Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins in Veal Broth. Turpentine Clyſters are very conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, when Coſtiveneſs is caus'd by Nephritic Pains. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Oyl, or the Oyls of Linſeed and Rapeſeed are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more effectual than any other Ingredients. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of Rape Oyl, in which a dram of, Troches Alhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal has been boyl'd, eight ounces; with an ounce of Hony of Roſes, and the yelk of one Egg; make a Clyſter.</p>
                        <p>If Emollient Clyſters prove ineffectual, and the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be notably harden'd, let Sal Gem be added to 'em As for Example,</p>
                        <pb n="101" facs="tcp:207638:60"/>
                        <p>Take of Chamomil Leaves and Flowers, three handfuls; Elder and Mullein Flowers, of each a handful; boyl them in Water. To nine ounces of the ſtrain'd liquor, add of Sal Gem, a Dram; Hony of Roſes, an ounce; make a Clyſter. If Wind moleſt the Guts, add of the diſtill'd Oyls of Cumin and Caraway-ſeeds, of each half a Scruple. If Sal Gem be inſufficient, add a dram of Coloquintida ty'd in a Bag to be boyl'd with the other Ingredients; ſtill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving this Caution, that when ſuch, ſharp Ingredients are added, Oyls, and ſuch like things ought to be omitted, for theſe cramp the others. And in the laſt place, if Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quintida it ſelf be inſufficient, in the room of it add two, three, or four ounces of the infuſion of <hi>Crocus Metallorum;</hi> but withal, 'tis ſtill to be remembred, that if the Guts be irritated, or moleſted with Contractions, the ſimple ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Clyſters are only proper; and that the uſe of ſuch ſharp Ingredients is to be nicely confin'd to the caſe of the inſenſibility and relaxation of the Guts.</p>
                        <p>Next to Clyſters are Suppoſitories made of Salt, Hony, Powder of black Hellebor, and a ſmall quantity of Sal Gem. <hi>Sylvius,</hi> and other Authors, are very diffuſe in commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Suppoſitories of Allum, either mix'd in Powder with Tragacanth diſſolv'd in white Lilly-water; or a piece of Rock allum cut into the form of a Suppoſitory, and anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Oyl of ſweet Almonds. But during the uſe of Clyſters and Suppoſitories, 'tis proper to exhibit ſome lax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative inwardly, leſt an ineffectual Provocation of the Guts ſhou'd creat an Inflammation. 'Tis likewiſe convenient in the mean while to foment or bathe the Belly; and after bathing, to anoint it, thus;</p>
                        <p>Take of the Leaves of common Mallows, Marſh-mallows, Plantane, and Wormwood, of each a handful; Chamomil and Melilot Flowers, of each half a handful; Seeds of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nugrec, Linſeeds and Cucumberſeeds, of each a ſcruple. Boyl them in Wine till two parts be conſumed. Foment the Belly with the Decoction.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Oyls of ſweet Almonds, Violets, Lillies, Roſes, Chamomil, and Spikenard, of each half an ounce; Gooſe fat an ounce; with a little of the Plaiſter of Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries, make a Liniment; with which anoint the Belly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fomentation.</p>
                        <p>If the motion of the Inteſtines be much impair'd, let the Oyntments be ſharpen'd with Bull's Gall, and Sal Gem; or apply a Plaiſter of Bull's Gall, and Oyl of Coloquintida
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:207638:61"/>to the Navel. <hi>Zivet,</hi> eſpecially in Colic Pains, us'd the ſame way, is a valuable Secret. The Ointment of Soubread ſoften'd with Oyl of Coloquintida, is very uſeful for the ſame purpoſe. As alſo Elaterum, or Scammony, or Aloe, mix'd with Oyl of Coloquintida. Some mix Gooſe fat with a roaſted Apple, and apply it to the Belly. Others apply Oyl of Poplar with <hi>Hiera Picra</hi> to the Soles of the Feet. Some chooſe to anoint their Fingers with Rape or Linſeed Oyl, and ſo thruſt 'em into the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dament; and they ſay 'tis a very effectual Method.</p>
                        <p>Coughing and ſneezing are recommended by <hi>Platerus,</hi> as fit means for forwarding the Excrements. <hi>Meibomius</hi> gives an inſtance of a Prince that was wont to cauſe his Servant to whip him to Stool.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>THE Iliac Paſſion is an extreme Coſtiveneſs, pain about the Navel, and voiding of the Excrements upwards, caus'd by the inverted periſtaltic Motion of the Guts. If the Inverſion of the periſtaltic Motion commence from the <hi>Pylorus,</hi> it creates Vomiting; if from the Guts, which are a Continuation of the Membran of the Stomac, it produces the ſame Symptoms. For the moſt part it takes its riſe from the <hi>Ileum,</hi> tho' ſometimes it begins at the <hi>Rectum,</hi> or Colon; as appears by their Inflammations, and other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervables in dead Bodies.</p>
                        <p>The Cauſes are Ulcers of the Guts, extreme Coſtiveneſs, or acid auſtere Excrements irritating their Fibres, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Obſtructions, eſpecially about the <hi>Caecum;</hi> a Rupture; The Corrugation of the Guts by a Gangrene, miſtaken by ſome for a twiſting of 'em round one another, a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with their ligation to the Meſentery; The run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one Gut into another, caus'd by Wind diſtending one beyond its natural Capacity, while the other retains its wonted bulk, apt to be ſwallowed up by the larger; (This entrance of one Gut into another, may be promoted by Perſons unquietneſs and toſſing in the extremity of their Pain; Convulſive Contractions of the Guts, Coalition of their Sides, Corroſion of their Valves, and Inflammations caus'd by over-acid Juices, and attended by Feavers, which, if a Gangrene inſue, become malignant.</p>
                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:207638:61"/>
                        <p>The ſigns of an approaching Iliac Paſſion, are extreme Goſtiveneſs, retraction of the <hi>Anus,</hi> a loathing, vomiting, and intolerable Pains in the ſmall Guts; and if a Hiccough inſue, it threatens Death. If the <hi>Anus</hi> be much drawn back, ſo that a Clyſter-pipe cannot enter, it is a ſign, that the groſs Inteſtines are affected. If otherwiſe, the ſmall Guts are only touch'd. If the greateſt Pain be ſeated in the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſtrium,</hi> the <hi>Ilium</hi> is moſt oppreſs'd. A ſhooting burning Pain in one particular part of the Belly, a <hi>Lipyria</hi> Feaver, Thirſt, and ardor of the Stomac, are ſigns of an Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If the Pain be over, and follow'd by cold Sweats, difficult Reſpiration, Swoonings, and ſometimes Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, 'tis a ſign of a Gangrene. In <hi>fine,</hi> the common Symptoms of an Iliac Paſſion are hardneſs of the Belly, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Urine, loathing, vomiting, firſt of the Contents of the Stomac, and next the Excrements; a ſtinking habit of Body, frequent Swoonings, inſufferable griping Pains in the Guts, a prodigious anxiety, and ſometimes vomiting of Clyſters.</p>
                        <p>Inflammations or Gangrenes are Mortal. If the upper Gut deſcend into the lower, 'tis a fatal Symptom. If the lower aſcend into the higher, 'tis curable. If the Diſeaſe proceed from a Rupture, or harden'd Excrements, 'tis not deſperat. If Sleep ſucceed to the taking of Opiats, 'tis a hopeful Circumſtance. The Hiccough, Deaſneſs, Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, or Doatings, are bad Conſequences. If the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be vomited, and if the Sweat, Breath, Belchings, and Wind voided downwards, ſtink much; 'tis a dangerous caſe.</p>
                        <p>The Cure conſiſts in removing the Irritation, and retrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the natural periſtaltic Motion of the Guts. In general, the following Rules will direct us;</p>
                        <p n="1">1. If the Excrements be harden'd, they muſt be ſoften'd with Clyſters betimes, elſe we labor in Vain. 2. All Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives are improper, till ſuch time as the Guts and Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac are appeas'd, and reſtor'd to their natural Motion, 3. Tho' the Symptoms diſappear, we ought not to think our ſelves ſecure, till large quantities of humors be voided downwards, eitheir by a natural or artificial force. 4. The weakneſs and dejection of the Parts, which is caus'd by the ſtink attending this Diſeaſe, ought be always accounted for by exhibiting Confection Alkermes, Spirit of Triacle cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoris'd, Cinnamom Water, Ambergriſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 5. In caſe of a Gangrene, Opiats are very noxious; as likewiſe in that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:207638:62"/>of Obſtructions, till ſuch time as the Belly be well open'd. When the Diſeaſe proceeds from a violent Irritation, and is attended by a furious everlaſting Vomiting, Opiats may be mix'd with Stomachical Medicines, while the Perſon is yet ſtrong. 6. Whatever is us'd, whether outwardly, or inwardly, muſt be warm, as well in the time of Recovery, as that of the fit.</p>
                        <p>Now, as to particular Caſes. If the ſmall Guts only be inverted, emollient Clyſters, quicken'd, if need be, with Coloquintida, Sal Gem, or Antimonial Infuſions; or thoſe of the Carminative Seeds boyl'd in Childs Urine and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; or of the Decoction of Sheeps Guts and Caul; or in caſe of an Inflammation, thoſe of Nitre and Barly-water; are proper. But if the motion of the groſs Inteſtines be likewiſe inverted, all ſuch Clyſters promote the Irritation. Wherefore we are obliged in ſuch caſes to endeavour the Cure by temperat, ſoftening, laxative, lubrical Potions; as the Decoction of emollient Herbs in Broth, mix'd with the Oyl of ſweet Almonds; or the Oyl of ſweet Almonds new drawn, given to the quantity of three Ounces in Broth, with <hi>Sperma Gaeti.</hi> Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Decoction of Raiſins, with Tamarinds, half a Pound; Oyl of ſweet Almonds, two, or three Ounces; Syrup of Apples, an ounce and a half.</p>
                        <p>The Decoction of Rapes, or that of Chammomil Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with freſh Butter; or the juice of rotten Apples, is of good uſe. Some apply the Pulp of Apples with Saffron to the Belly. In a word, the ſame Method is to be follow'd in curing this Diſeaſe, as we recommended in the laſt Article.</p>
                        <p>When all other Medicines are ineffectual, we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to leaden Bullers, and Quickſilver. But in caſe of an Inflammation, Rupture, Gangrene, or deſcent of the upper Gut into the lower, the former are very noxious; and even in other Caſes they are frequently either inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, or hurtful. Wherefore Quickſilver claims the Prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Before we uſe it, the Body ought to be prepar'd with lubrical things, ſuch as Oyl of ſweet Almonds, or <hi>Sperma Caeti.</hi> Then exhibit three, four, and ſometimes eight ounces of purify'd Quickſilver, together with Oyl of ſweet Almonds, and Mint-water. If it do not ſucceed at firſt, let it be frequently repeated. And in the mean while inject emollient Clyſters, foment the Belly with ſoftening <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>coctions, or ſet the Perſon into a Bath. If the Mercury
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:207638:62"/>after frequent uſing do not paſs, make the Clyſters ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; anoint the Belly with Ointment of Soubread, and Oyl of Coloquintida, and apply the Plaiſter of Hemloc with Gum Ammoniac to ſoften the Excrements. If the Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſturb the Mouth, Throat, and Gums, Gargle 'em with Hony of Roſes, and Syrup of Violets. After the Body's open'd, 'tis likewiſe proper to exhibit the lunar Bezoar, and diaphoretic Antimony for carrying off the remains of the Mercury.</p>
                        <p>Beſides the above mention'd Emollient, and temperating Potions, ſome commend ſalt of Wormwood, with Juice of Limons; or the Spirit of Turpentin; or when the Guts are free of Inflammations, Venice Triacle diſſolv'd in Wine; for removing the Irritations; or the following Recipe's;</p>
                        <p>Take of Mint-water, two ounces; Cinnamom and Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doary Waters, of each half an ounce; Salt of Wormwood, half a dram; Laudanum Opiatum, two or three Grains; Syrup of Buckthorn, ſix drams. Make a Potion.</p>
                        <p>Take of Fennel, Mint, and carminative Waters, of each an ounce; Spirit of Salarmoniac aniſated, a dram and a half; Eſſence of Opium, a dram, Syrup of Mint, ſix drams; mix and exhibit in the beginning of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>Take of prepar'd Amber, Diaphoretic Antimony, Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar of Antimony, of each half a Scruple; Laudanum Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atum two grains; Camphyr, one grain; make a Powder Mineral Bezoar, and volatil Salt of Hartſhorn are likewiſe proper Ingredients.</p>
                        <p>If the Diſeaſe be caus'd by an Inflammation, let blood both in the Arm and Leg; let the Perſon abſtain from eating; let Clyſters of Nitre, Milk, and mucilage of Fleawort-ſeeds be injected; and exhibit a Potion of Mint-water, Spirit of <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle camphoriz'd, Salt of Wormwood, and Syrup of Buckthorn. Externally, anoint with the Oyntment of Marſhmallows, ſix drams; Oyl of Chamomil, half an ounce; diſtill'd Oyls of Juniper, and of Turpentin, of each a dram and a half, mix'd. After anointing, lay a hot Brick upon the Belly. Sometimes a Gangrene of the Guts cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes a retraction of the Yard and Teſticles, and it always ends in Death. If the Diſeaſe proceed from a Rupture, let ſharp Antimonial Clyſters be injected, and the Inteſtines reinſtated in their proper Places. If it proceed from an Ulcer, emollient laxative things are only to be us'd.</p>
                        <pb n="106" facs="tcp:207638:63"/>
                        <p>As for outward Applications, 'tis uſual to anoint the Belly with Diſtill'd Oyl of Chamomil mix'd with the fat of Geeſe or Ducks, for ſoftening the Excrements; or mix'd with Oyntment of Soubread and Oyl of Coloquyntida, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking to Stool. Cow dung applied to the Belly is ſometimes very effectual for mitigating the Pains. Some recommend the hot Caul of a gelded Lamb, others the Blood of Bats, or the caſtcoals of Serpents boyl'd with Oyl of Roſes, for External Application. Cataplaſms of ſheeps dung boyl'd with milk, or rotten Apples with Saffron, or Baths of the Decoction of Chamomil and Melilot-flowers, and Juniperberries, are proper for the ſame purpoſe.</p>

                        <p>WHen the Excrements are more frequently, or copiouſly vomited, than they ought to be, we call it a <hi>Diar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhaea,</hi> or Looſeneſs, which varies according to the Color and conſiſtence of the Excrements it diſcharges. If it be a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Looſeneſs, caus'd by the Tranſlation of Morbific Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or ſuppreſſion of ſome wonted Evacuation, change of Seaſon, or Diet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'tis of no great importance. That which we have now before us, is a preternatural Looſeneſs, which is ſometimes malignant and contagious, attended by cold Sweats, great Anxiety, and propagating it ſelf by the Breath; Sometimes more Benign. Sometimes it comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, at other times 'tis the Symptom of ſome other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, of which nature are the Looſeneſſes which attend the Beginning, or Increaſe of Malignant Fevers, or thoſe pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to Phthiſical conſumptive Perſons, which we ſtyle, Melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:207638:63"/>by reaſon that they drain the nouriſhing Juice. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we meet with Periodical Looſeneſſes, eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Cacochymical Perſons, which return every Quarter of a Year, Month, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Radical Subject of a Looſeneſs is the Maſs of Blood, which depoſits it Recrements either in the Form of Serum, thro the Glands of the Guts, or in that of Gall, or Pancrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Juice; not that it is actually ſtuff'd with ſo much Filth as is evacuated, but it degenerates and corrupts, as the Looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs advances. If the Bilious Particles prevail, and give the Excrements an high Tincture, 'tis call'd a Bilious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arrhaea; If the Pancreatic Juice, or Serum, 'tis entitled <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous:</hi> If Groſs, Viſcid, Indigeſted Humors be voided with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any notable Tincture, 'tis a Pituitous Looſeneſs.</p>
                        <p>The Cauſe of Looſeneſſes is a ſharp Volatil Humor, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Acid, ſometimes Alcalin, that either irritates the Guts, or ferments with the Natural Acid of the Blood, melting down its Maſs into Serum, much after the manner of Artificial Purgatives. This Humor is an Enemy to the Acid of the Stomac, and always depreſſes its Appetit. Nay, oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a deprav'd Acid in the Stomac is the occaſional cauſe of a Looſeneſs. Hence, whatever weakens the Ferment of the Stomac, promotes the other, and what cures the other fortifies the Stomac. Sometimes the Internal Corruption of the Humors, independent of the Stomac occaſions it, which frequently moleſts ſuch as are of a thick Texture and unfit for a free Tranſpiration, by reaſon that the Serum not finding an eaſy Paſſage on the Surface of the Body, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires to the Inteſtines to procure a vent. Melting Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Habitual Looſeneſſes proceed from the Deficiency of the Acid in the Stomac, and Acrimony of the Bile, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to the Chyle. All Corruptible things, or ſuch as are apt to ferment, do of courſe diſpoſe the Humors to a Looſeneſs.</p>
                        <p>The Signs are, a Loathing and Dejection of Appetit, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderat Thirſt, Weakneſs, Suppreſſion of Sweat, and Urine; a Noiſe, and ſome ſort of Griping in the Guts immediatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore going to ſtool. If it come to a great height, 'tis at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by Anxieties of the Breaſt, Swoonings and Cold Sweats, eſpecially upon the Forehead.</p>
                        <p>If a Looſeneſs accompany Spotted Feavers, or invade the Perſon in the Beginning of an Acute Feaver, 'tis very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, by reaſon that it weakens the Patient, diſturbs the Concoction and Separation of the Febril Matter, and is the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:207638:64"/>Effect of the Feaveriſh Colliquation; and upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ought always to be ſtopp'd, or at leaſt curb'd. If a Looſeneſs be follow'd by Vomiting, 'tis a good ſign. In a word, 'tis accounted dangerous, or favourable, according as the Stomac is in good or bad caſe. If the Excrements be much degenerat from their natural condition, as very groſs, white, green or Saffron colour'd; If frothy, gluy, pale, ſlippery and ſcantly; Eſpecially if they be black, ruſty, fat, livid, or foetid, they portend danger. If the Patient begin to void large quantities of Urin, and ſweat plentifully, we look upon the Looſeneſs as Declining. If a melting Looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs follow Acute Feavers, Conſumptions, Phthiſics, Hectics, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'tis very dangerous.</p>
                        <p>A Critical Looſeneſs ought not to be ſtopp'd, unleſs it exceed Bounds. Symptomatical and Epidemical Looſneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are thoſe which require the greateſt attention. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications of Cure, with relation to them, are theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: 1. The ſharp Ferment ought to be curb'd by moderat and thickening Medicines. 2. The Blood ought to be purify'd by Sudorifics. 3. The Irritating Cauſe temper'd by Abſorbents. 3. The Fury of the Spirits, and Senſe of Irritation, abated by Opiats. 5. The Corrupt Humors gently evacuated. 6. The Stomac ought to be reſtor'd to its due ſtrength and vigour. In order to obtain theſe Ends, let's take notice of the following Remarks.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. 'Tis impoſſible to cure a Looſeneſs without having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Stomac. Therefore let Wine, and the Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Wormwoad, Mint, Quinces, Cinnamom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the External Fomentations and Inunctions recommended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, be us'd in this Caſe. Let all Cold Drinks be prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, and as little of any Liquor allow'd as poſſibly can be done. 2. All Purgatives are improper againſt Sympto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical and malignant Looſeneſſes. They ought rather to be appeas'd than provok'd. 3. In all Malignant, Contagious, Epidemical Looſeneſſes, Alexioharmacal Ingredients, ſuch as Spirit of <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle, Bezoardic Tincture, with <hi>Opium,</hi> ſeal'd Earth, fix'd Antimonial Preparations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are much the beſt. If the Looſeneſs proceed only from an Irritation of the Guts, they are not ſo needful. 4. 'Tis not proper to purge in the beginning of any Looſeneſs whatſoever. The beſt way is either to ſuffer it to go on a little, if it do not exceed meaſure, or firſt to check the Boyling Humors, and then, if need be, to waſh off the Dregs with Rhubarb and Tamarinds, or Gentle Clyſters. 5. If a Loathing, Giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:207638:64"/>Anxiety of the Breaſt, and Diſorders of the Stomac accompany a Looſeneſs in the beginning, let a Vomit be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited. 6. Aſtringents, as ſuch, are not properly any part of the Cure of a Looſeneſs. After the Cure of a tedious Looſeneſs is finiſh'd, they may be uſeful for ſtrengthning the Fibres of the Guts. But to what Purpoſe ſhould the Irritating and Floating Humors be bound up? 'Tis better they ſhould take their Courſe than be thrown upon a Nobler Part. 'Tis true, Tormentil, ſeal'd Earth, Sugar of Lead, and ſuch like things, are very uſeful; but 'tis not upon the account of their Adſtringent, but Abſorbing and Correcting Vertue. 7. 'Tis the Ridiculous Humor of ſome to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void Wine. Whereas nothing is more Friendly to the Stomac, or more proper againſt a Looſeneſs.</p>
                        <p>Of All the Medicines us'd againſt Looſeneſſes, <hi>Opium</hi> is the Head. 'Tis a Powerful Controuler of all Tumultuous Motions. 'Tis exhibited in Vinegar. Or rather, Recent <hi>Diaſcordium</hi> may ſupply its Room, being given from a Dram to two Drams. Some extoll the uſe of two Eggs boyl'd very hard, ſprinkled with Roſe-Vinegar, and Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Mace and Nutmegs.

                        <p>The external Remedies mention'd in the laſt Article, are proper in this. Spirit of Wine camphoris'd, mix'd with <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle, is a noble Epithema for the Stomac, if ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd hot with ſeveral folds of Linnen.</p>
                        <p>If a Cholera proceed from an Error in Diet, it ſometimes happens, but very rarely, that a gentle cleanſing Medicine wou'd not be amiſs; Such as are Whey alter'd with ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Syrup of Roſes, or Pulp of Tamarinds, gentle Infuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Rhubarb, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But Milk Clyſters, with <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle, or Diaſcordium diſſolv'd in 'em, are always uſeful.</p>

                        <p>The uſe of Signs is to diſtinguiſh the Cauſes. If the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac be irritated, there's a gnawing heat in the Stomac, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd by Vomiting. If the ferment be weak, the Appetit is dejected, the Breath fetid, and the Cavity of the Stomac and Guts moleſted with Wind and Noiſe.

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:207638:67"/>a Scurvy, or ſeize Women with Child, 'tis very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
                        <p>The Indications of Cure are to corroborat the Stomac and Pylorus, by Medicines preſcrib'd in the firſt Section of this Book; and mitigat the irritating Acrimony of Humors, by ſuch Remedies as are us'd againſt a Cholera, Looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Gentle Vomits are proper, if the Stomac be ſtuff'd with pituitous Excrements. But ſuch as are fat and oily ought to be avoided, for they relaxat the Fibres of the Stomac. If Vomiting be not convenient, gentle aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Purgatives are allowable, ſuch as Rhubarb, or the Pills of Aloe; or thoſe of Maſtic. But by all means, let ſtrong Purges be prohibited. If there be any ſuſpicion of Poyſon, or if the <hi>Lienteria</hi> proceed from Summer Fruits, and ſuch corruptible things, let Alexipharmacal Medicines be exhibited.</p>
                        <p>As for corroborating Medicines, ſee the Chapter of <hi>Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and that of a looſeneſs.

                        <p>The Cauſe is ſome ſharp acid, that irritates the Guts, provokes 'em to Contractions, aſſembles the Blood by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of its Provocation, and corrodes the Orifices of the Blood Veſſels.

If the acidity and ſharpneſs be owing to theſe Cauſes, the <hi>Dyſentery</hi> is benign and free of Contagion. But the cauſe of an epidemical malignant contagious looſeneſs, is a corrupt, volatil acid, not lodg'd in the Guts, but immediately reigning in the Blood, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting its texture, opening the Veſſels inſerted into the Guts, and provoking 'em to convulſive Contractions; from whence inſue a malignant Feaver, Gripings, and bloody Stools. So that tho previous Excoriations may take place in benign Dyſenteries, there is no occaſion for 'em in the contagious malignant ſort. It being a ſufficient cauſe of bloody Stools, that the cauſtic ferment is a mortal Enemy to the Guts, like to that of Antimony, or Arſenic, that perpetually thwarts and provokes 'em to Convulſions. Upon which they ſqueeze out their blood together with their nutritious Juice, that they are not then in a Capacity to receive; and which is by ſome taken for the Mucus of the Guts, whereas the large Quantities that are voided do ſufficiently evince the contrary.</p>
                        <p>The ſigns are theſe. The ſick Perſon is ſeiz'd with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable griping Pains in the Guts, follow'd by frequent ſtools, at firſt of whitiſh matter, afterwards of Blood and ſlime mix'd together. When he goes to Stool, he is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly tortur'd, and the Guts and Bowels ſeem to deſcend. If the Dyſentery be malignant, 'tis wonderfully contagious; propagating it ſelf not only by the Breath, but by uſing the ſame Clyſter-pipe. A malignant Feaver, and all its diſmal Symptoms accompany it. If in the progreſs of the Diſeaſe, pure Blood be voided, 'tis a ſign of the corroſion or open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome large Veſſel in the Guts, or Meſentery. If a Dyſentery be unſeaſonably ſtop'd, the Guts are inflam'd, and gangren'd; the Throat beſet with Wheals and Pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; the <hi>Inteſtinum Rectum</hi> ſometimes moleſted with a Teneſmus and do vnfalling, the Appetit dejected; upon
<pb facs="tcp:207638:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>which inſue Nauſeating, Vomiting, the Hiccough, Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and at laſt fatal Convulſions.</p>
                        <p>If the great Guts are affected, the Pain is heavy and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, ſeated towards the ſides of the Belly, and quickly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by Stools; the Excrements, Slime, and Blood, are but indifferently mix'd, and the Stomac leſs diſorder'd, than when the ſmall Guts are the ſeat of the Evil; for then there is a notable propenſion to Vomit, the pain is more pricking and ſhooting, plac'd above and below the Navel, and not ſo quickly follow'd by Evacuations; and the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when evacuated, is exactly mix'd, without any ſigns of diſtinction.</p>
                        <p>There are three degrees obſervable in a Dyſentery. The Symptoms of the firſt, are bloody and ſlimy Stools. In the ſecond, the ſlime gives ſome ſigns of an Excoriation; and in the third, of an Exulceration. When the Guts are excoriated, 'tis either the Cruſt that covers 'em, or part of their thick Tunicle, or at moſt, the Caruncles or inflam'd Glandules of the Guts, that is voided.</p>
                        <p>If a Dyfentery be attended by a Vomiting, Hiccough, and malignant Symptoms; if the Excrements are green, black, or fetid; if the Looſeneſs began from a green, black, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive Bile; or an acid, ſalin, tenacious Pituita; 'tis a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Caſe. Convulſions and Doatings uſher in Death. The voiding of Caruncles is a fatal ſign. The Indolency of the Guts ſignifies a Gangrene. If the <hi>Anus</hi> be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted that nothing can enter, it beſpeaks a fatal tumor in the <hi>Inteſtinum Rectum;</hi> if it hang out and open, ſo that Clyſters are not retain'd, tis Paralytic. A Feaver ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Dyſentery, is a ſign of the Inflammation or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Inteſtins. A Dyſentery is frequently fatal to Women with Child, unleſs it be very benign, and not long before the time of Delivery. If a bitter taſte in the Mouth, and bilious Vomits happen in the beginning; if a Lienteria, Hiccough, wheals in the Throat, or ſpots in the Face, happen after it has continu'd ſome time; and if the Inteſtines are ulcerated, Death is at hand. If the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon belch or fart, 'tis a good ſign. If the great Guts are the proper ſeat of the Evil, there's leſs danger. Sple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netic and gouty People are ſometimes benefited by a Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery.</p>
                        <p>Now in order to form a diſtinct Idea of the Cure, let us firſt give ear to the following Cautions;</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <pb n="119" facs="tcp:207638:69"/>1. That by all means we ought to diſtinguiſh malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Dyſenteries from ſuch as are benign; thoſe from an internal Cauſe, from others externally occaſion'd.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Notwithſtanding the Clamors of ſome Authors, Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotics are very proper, eſpecially in the beginning; but they ought to be mixt with convenient Specifics, and given in very large Doſes; for Perſons under this Diſeaſe can bear <hi>Opium</hi> wonderfully.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. In malignant Dyſenteries laxative Medicines are very nocive; but in benign ones they're approv'd, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, if the Conſtitution of the Patient be Cacochymical, or if the Dyſentery proceed from Summer Fruits. Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb and Whey are fitteſt for this purpoſe, but Narcotics ought to be mix'd with 'em; and likewiſe exhibited by themſelves, both the preceding and following Nights.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Vomits are very dangerous; yet if the Chyle be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and the Stomac much oppreſs'd, if the Perſon vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit eaſily, and have ſufficient Strength to undergo the Tryal, they may be ventur'd on. But withal, in a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Dyſentery they are abſolutely noxious, unleſs an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violent Purge or Poyſon have occaſion'd it.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Sudorifics are always proper in Epidemical Dyſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and ought never to be omitted. They are much preferable to Purgatives, or any other Medicines what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Aſtringents are very offenſive at firſt. After the uſe of gentle abſtergent Laxatives in benign, and that of Alexipharmacal Sudorifics in malignant Dyſenteries, they may be given in the declenſion of the Diſeaſe, but not before.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Blood-letting is to no purpoſe in moſt caſes. Nay, even in the caſe of a ſuppreſſion of the Terms, it ought to be cautiouſly attempted, if the Dyſentery be malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. All Clyſters whatſoever, tho never ſo ſoftening, irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat the Guts in ſome meaſure, and promote a Teneſmus; upon which account they ought to be very cautiouſly and ſparingly us'd. They are moſt proper in the declination of the Diſeaſe, when the great Inteſtines are affected, or ſtuff'd with ſharp Humors, and when the Dyſentery is benign.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. A peculiar regard muſt be always had to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac, whoſe good or bad Condition alone ſtamps a hopeful
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:207638:70"/>or deſperat Character on a Dyſentery. Warm Wine mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly us'd, is proper for this purpoſe.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. The Feet, and external parts ought to be kept warm; for the leaſt Cold, or the drinking of any cold Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, revives and exaſperats the Diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. There's nothing ſo conducive as Reſt and Quiet. They ought not to ſtir from their Beds, nor move when they are in 'em.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Venery is oft-times a Sovereign Cure for a Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery.</p>
                        <p>From what is premis'd, we may infer the Indications for Cure, <hi>viz.</hi> To put a ſtop to the Irritation of the Inteſtins, and repair the loſs they've ſuſtain'd; to purify the Blood, and ſeparat the preternatural ferment.</p>
                        <p>As for the particular Medicines anſwering theſe ends, we ſhall firſt run over the Specifics peculiar to this Diſeaſe. In which Claſs the Pizzle of a Whale leads the Van; next is a Staggs Pizzle. They are never pounded, but only ſhav'd. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of the ſhavings of a Stags Pizzle, two drams; Hyſteric Laudanum, nine Grains; make a Powder for two Doſes.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Decoction of a Whale's Pizzle, a Pound and a half; Cinnamom-water, an ounce; Syrup of Coral, two or three ounces. Make a Julep; of which let the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent take a Draught over Night. They may be mix'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Powder or Decoction with other ſpecific and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Ingredients, of which more anon.</p>
                        <p>The next Specific is Hartſhorn; Its Decoction with Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net is commended by <hi>Riverius,</hi> for ordinary drinking. Its Gelly may be mix'd with the Gelly of Stags Pizzle, and diſſolv'd in any Liquor. Or thus;</p>
                        <p>Take of the Decoction of the ſhavings of a Stag's Pizzle, a Pound, Gelly of Hartſhorn, ſix drams; Cinnamom-water, ſix drams; Syrup of Comfrey, an ounce. Make a Julep.</p>
                        <p>Next in order are the ſhavings of the Scull of a Man that dies a violent death, given to a dram; the Moſs of the Scull, given to a ſcruple; the Powder of a Sea-horſe Tooth, or Unicorn's Horn, given to a dram; Oak Berries; Miſſelto of the Oak: The Powder prepar'd from Elder-berries, call'd, <hi>Tragaea Granorum Actes,</hi> baken up anew with Hairs-blood, and Stag's Pizzle, and freſh Juice of the Berries; the blood of a Hare kill'd by Dogs, given in Powder to a dram or by way of Infuſion; a Clour ſoak'd in it, being
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:207638:70"/>infus'd in Ale or ordinary Drink: the Blood of a Lamb Kill'd after frighting, us'd after the ſame method; the dry'd Livers of Serpents and Vipers given to a Scruple; Cryſtal, the Livers of Green Frogs, an Apple excavated and fill'd with Wax and Gum Arabic and ſo Roaſted; or rather a Quince with the ſame Ingredients Roaſted; the Dung of a Dog fed with Bones given to a Dram in Steeled Goats Milk, the Pouder of Horſe-hoof given to a Dram, <hi>Satyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> Roots by way of Infuſion, the Decoction or Pouder of Cork, Wallnut-Catkins given to a Dram in Pouder, Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentil, Rob of Sorbe Apples, Mineral Unicorn, Dulcify'd Earth of Vitriol taken from the Vitriol of Steel, Sulphur and its Flowers, Aſhwood given to a Dram in warm Wine, and Allum, of which Four or Five Grains are given with Cinnamom very ſucceſsfully.</p>
                        <p>Thus far the moſt Noted Specifics. The Common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients which we uſually joyn to them are the Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, Styptic, abſorbent and fat Oily Medicines, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended againſt Vomiting, Looſeneſſes, and the <hi>Cholera.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Goats Milk in the beginning of the Diſeaſe is a good Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtergent, and towards the end, Cows Milk Conſolidats and Heals. Chalybeat Milk with Comfrey and Tormentil Roots, or the ſhavings of Stag's Pizzle, or Rice, or Yelks of Eggs and Juice of Ivy boyl'd in it, is of excellent uſe. The Eſſence and Syrup of Comfrey, the Extract of <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle, or that of Tormentil given with <hi>Laudanum Opiatum</hi> at Night in Pills; The Spirit of Venice Treacle Camphoris'd; The Tincture of Coral Prepar'd with Spirit of Saſſafras; The Tincture of the Sulphur of Vitriol; The Styptic Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor Prepar'd from Seal'd Earth and Spirit of Nitre, call'd, <hi>Liquor Aureus;</hi> The Tincture of Blood-ſtone; Myrrh, and its Eſſence; Amber, and its Troches; Sugar of Lead (a Noted Specific) The Tincture Extracted from the Earth of Gold Mines by Spirit of Salt; Theſe I ſay, are all Common Ingredients. A few Receipts ſhall ſerve for Examples.</p>
                        <p>In a Benign Dyſentery, if it be Convenient either in the Beginning or Declenſion to Purge, of which we muſt be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cautious; Let <hi>Laudanum Opiatum</hi> be exhibited over Night; then in the Morning take of <hi>Diaſcordium,</hi> a Dram; Rhubarb, two Scruples; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> two Grains; With Syrup of Quinces make a Bolus, to be Reiterated. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of Plantan Water, an Ounce; Powder of Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb, a Dram; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> a Grain; With Syrup of Quinces make a Potion.</p>
                        <pb n="122" facs="tcp:207638:71"/>
                        <p>In a Malignant Dyſentery let Laxatives be omitted, and preſcribe thus. Take of Hartſhorn Prepar'd without fire, a Scruple; Diaphoretic Antimony, half a Scruple; Volatil Salt of Vipers, five Grains; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> one Grain. Mix.</p>
                        <p>Take of Mint Water, an Ounce; Spirit of <hi>Venice</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle Camphoris'd, two Drams; Diaphoretic Antimony, a Scruple; Human Bones calcin'd, half a Scruple; Extract of <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle, five Grains; Syrup of <hi>Carduus Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus,</hi> half an Ounce. Make a Potion for one Doſe.</p>
                        <p>In fine, the Common Preſcriptions againſt all ſorts of Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteries are ſuch as theſe following.</p>
                        <p>Take of the ſhavings of a Stag's Pizzle, half an Ounce; Comfrey Roots, Tragacanth and Nutmegs, of each three Drams; ſeal'd Earth, Bole Armenic, Burnt Hartſhorn and Zedoary, of each a Dram and an half. Make a Powder. You may add <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> and Oyl of Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mom.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Extract of Tormentil, twenty four Grains; Vipers Livers, Prepar'd Crabs Eyes, of each a Scruple; Hyſteric <hi>Laudanum,</hi> nine Grains; Diſtill'd Oyl of Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mom, two Drops. Mix for two Doſes. Ye may add Troches of Amber and Prepar'd Cryſtal.</p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle, a Dram; Prepar'd Blood-ſtone, a Scruple; Dead Men's Bones Calcin'd, fifteen Grains; Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar of Lead, ſix Grains. Make a Bolus.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Rob of the Fruit of the Service Tree, a Dram and a half; Chalybeat-Bezoar, fifteen Grains; Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify'd Earth of Vitriol, ſix Grains; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> two Grains, make a Bolus.</p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Diaſcordium,</hi> an Ounce and a half; the Shav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a Whales Pizzle, three Drams; Troches of Amber, a Dram and a half; Flowers of Sulphur, a Dram. With Juice of Quinces, make an Electuary. Of which take a Convenient quantity at Morning, Noon, and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                        <p>Take of Crude Allum, half a Dram; Cinnamon, an Ounce and a half. Make a Powder. Doſe a Scruple to be taken in Red Wine.</p>
                        <p>Take of Tormentil Water, two or three Ounces; Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Water Prepar'd with Quinces, an Ounce; Spirit of Venice Treacle Camphoris'd, three Drams; Syrup of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey, an Ounce. Mix for a Vehicle to the above-mention'd Powders.</p>
                        <pb n="123" facs="tcp:207638:71"/>
                        <p>Take of Plantan Water, three Ounces; Cinnamon Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſix Drams; Vinegar of Roſes, half an Ounce; <hi>Diaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordium,</hi> two Drams; Troches of Amber, or thoſe of Seal'd Earth, half a Dram; Prepar'd Crabs Eyes two Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; Diaphoretic Antimony, a Scruple; Syrup of Myrtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries, or of Quinces, an Ounce: Mix. Sugar of Lead, Dulcify'd Earth of Vitriol, Extract of Tormentil and Shavings of a Dead Man's Scull, may be added or mutually ſhifted by turns.</p>
                        <p>After the Symptoms are mitigated by the uſe of the foregoing Preſcriptions, it will not be improper to exhibit ſome healing things calculated for the Corroſion or Ulcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Inteſtines. Such are the Balſam of Sulphur pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with Oyl of Amber or Annis, or of Juniper-berries, or of Turpentin; Balſam of <hi>Peru</hi> given to half a Scruple with Sugar, or with the Yelk of an Egg: To which we may add the Vulnerary Decoctions. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Leaves of Ground-Ivy, Plantan and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentil, of each a handful; Pomgranat Flowers three little handfuls; Shavings of a Whale's Pizzle three Ounces. Boyl 'em in Black-Smiths-water. To two Pounds of the ſtrain'd Liquor add Syrup of Coral, and that of Comfrey, of each three Ounces. Mix and exhibit a large Draught twice or thrice a day, with fifteen Drops of the Balſam of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur.</p>
                        <p>As for Clyſters, we ought to be very cautious of uſing 'em. Anodyn Clyſters for allaying the Pain, and temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſharp Humors, are made of Chalybeat Milk, with E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mollent Ingredients boyl'd in it, and mix'd with <hi>Lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Opiatum,</hi> Turpentin, <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle, Goats Tallow and Yelks of Eggs. Pouders are not convenient, for they ſtick to the Guts, and provoke 'em. Vulnerary Healing Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are prepar'd from Vulnerary Decoctions, or the Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or Juice of River Crabs mix'd with Balſam of <hi>Peru,</hi> Goats Tallow and Oyl of Linſeed.</p>
                        <p>Externally apply a Plaiſter of <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle to the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and take of Expreſs'd Oyl of Nutmegs half an Ounce, Balſam of Sulphur prepar'd with Oyl of <hi>Anis</hi> two Drams, Balſam of <hi>Peru</hi> a Dram. Make a Liniment, and anoint the Belly.</p>
                        <p>Take of Oak leaves and Bran, of each three handfuls, Flowers of Chamomil and of Mullein of each two hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls. Make two Quilted Bags to be dipp'd in warm Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar; one large and round to be applied to the Navel, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther long and ſmall for the Breech.</p>
                        <pb n="124" facs="tcp:207638:72"/>
                        <p>Some reap benefit by ſitting upon the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> of Vitriol when they go to ſtool, others by applying a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm of Arſemart Leaves, bruis'd and beaten up with Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeat Wine; others by receiving the ſmoak of Burnt Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn, or Vinegar, or Ginger, thrown upon burning Coals juſt under their Breech, when they go to ſtool.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>Teneſmus</hi> is a Retainer to Dyſenteries, being a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual but vain deſire of going to ſtool. The Immediat Cauſe is the irritation of the <hi>Inteſtinum Rectum,</hi> eſpecially that part of it that is ſurrounded with the Sphincter. This Irritation may proceed by Conſent or Sympathy from Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phritic Pains, a Stone in the Bladder, or Diſtention of the Womb; or Eſſentially from a tenacious Corroſive Acid Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor thrown upon that Gut, either by a preceeding Dyſente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or ſharp Purgatives; from Inflammations occaſion'd by the ſuppreſſion of the Piles, and the Corroſion of the worms call'd <hi>Aſcarides.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>An Eſſential <hi>Teneſmus</hi> is more dangerous than a Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical one. If it continue long it degenerats into Ulcers and Fiſtula's of the <hi>Anus.</hi> In Women with Child it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cauſes miſcarriage.</p>
                        <p>As for the Cure. Let the Irritation be abated by Opiats. If a <hi>Teneſmus</hi> proceed from a ſharp renacious humor, Abſtergent Clyſters and Fomentations are proper. If the Inteſtin be excoriated, temperat ſoft Ingredients are requir'd.</p>
                        <p>Take of Mullein flowers, two handfuls; Seeds of Red Vetches, two Ounces; Salt of Tartar, a Dram; Boyl 'em in Water. To a Pound of the ſtrain'd Liquor add two Ounces of Goats Tallow, and an Ounce of Hony of Roſes. Mix for two Clyſters. The Decoction of Worms in Milk is likewiſe very proper. But all Clyſters ought to be injected in ſmall quantities at a time.</p>
                        <p>Foment the Anus with the Decoction of Mullein flowers in Milk. Or apply a bag quilted with Toad flax and Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lein Leaves, and the flowers of Mullein and Chamomil, and boyl'd in Chalybeat Milk. Or let the Anus be fumigated with hot Bricks, or Iron, thrown into warm Vinegar; Or with the Decoction of Savin in Water and Vinegar; Or with Myrrh, Frankincenſe, Roſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thrown upon burning Coals.</p>
                        <p>If the Inteſtin be Ulcerated, inject Vulnerary Decoctions with the Oyl of Wax. Or anoint with a Liniment of the Oyl of Roſes, and Earthworms mix'd with the Solution of Litharge in Vinegar; Or thruſt up a ſuppoſitory of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guentum
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:207638:72"/>Album Camphoratum, Diapompholygos, and dulcify'd Earth of Vitriol.</p>
                        <p>Internally the Oyl of Maſtic with Mint Water, or the red Oyl of Vitriol with Broth, is much approv'd.</p>
                        <p>The Hepatic flux is a Painleſs voiding of Watry Blood from the Internal Hemorrhoid Veins, which the Ancients fancy'd to proceed from the Liver. It either follows the Excoriation caus'd by a preceeding Dyſentery, or is occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd by the ordinary Cauſes of Eruption of Blood, of which elſewhere. Opiats, Aſtringents, and gentle Laxatives, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Raiſins, are the Baſis of its Cure.</p>
                        <p>Some Perſons are troubled with an Itching of the Anus. If it be caus'd by the approach of any External ſharp thing, let it be fomented with warm Milk and Roſe Water. If it tend to an Ulcer apply a Liniment of Sulphur, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharge, and Tragacanth mix'd with Vinegar and Oyl of Roſes. Oft-times Plantan Water and Allum are alſo very effectual.</p>

                        <head>ARTIC. II. <hi>Of the Piles.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THE Hemorrhoid Veins are either Internal or External, The Internal proceed from the meſenteric Branch of the <hi>Vena Portae;</hi> the External from the ſame Branch of the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> as thoſe of the womb, and ſo frequently diſcharge the Blood that was wont to be evacuated by the terms, as in the caſe of Suppreſſion or Ceſſation of the terms, or being with Child.</p>
                        <p>The Blood ſtagnating in theſe Hemorrhoid Veſſels cauſes oft-times a dry Inflammation, ſtraitening the Cavity of the Guts, and occaſioning a prodigious Pain in voiding the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, ſitting, walking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It riſes up to a great ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and hangs out of the Gut in various forms, ſometimes miſtaken for warts, or other occaſional tumors; and if it be not diſcuſ'd or open'd, degenerats into a Scirrhus, or an Ulcer.</p>
                        <p>If the Veſſels give way to the Blood it runs out either by drops from the Veins, or with a full current from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries. Sometimes this Evacuation is Natural and Periodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, returning every Month or Week in Men, as the terms in Women; Sometimes 'tis Critical infering the ſolution of an Acute Diſtemper. Sometimes not only Blood, but a watry
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:207638:73"/>humor reſembling the Whites in Women, is voided by the ſame Veſſels. This evacuation by the Hemorrhoids for the moſt part is involuntary, tho' ſome few by Cuſtom may have obtain'd a Privilege of commanding them when they will.</p>
                        <p>The Cauſe of this Flux or Stagnation of Blood is either Internal or External. The former is ſome ſharp ſalin fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Blood, following Melancholic, Scorbutic and Splenetic Diſtempers, or occaſion'd by ſuppreſſion of Blood, and ſuch like Accidents. This vicious ferment irritats the tender Fibres, and creats an Inflammation, Pain, and other Symptoms.</p>
                        <p>The External Cauſes are, Riding, Running, Leaping, or whatever ſtretches thoſe Veſſels; any ſudden Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Blood by Anger, Exerciſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hard Labor of Women with Child, Suppreſſion of the Terms, and the uſe of Roſinous Purgatives, which ſtick to the Guts, and velli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat the Orifices of the Veſſels.</p>
                        <p>The Eſſential Symptom of the Piles, is a green colour of the Face. A pain in the Loyns, without a manifeſt Cauſe, prognoſticats their approach. They are diſtinguiſh'd from ſcorbutic Evacuations of Blood, in that they are generally exaſperated by going to Stool, and the Blood for the moſt part is voided together with the Excrements. The dry Piles are diſtinguiſh'd from other Excreſcences, by their being of a different Subſtance from the Breech, round, black, plac'd at the extremities of the Veins, and being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together free of Fleſh, or Ulceration.</p>
                        <p>If the Piles be Chronical, or accompany Chronical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, ſuch as the Scurvy, Melancholly, Obſtructions of the Bowels, and eſpecially Arthritic Pains, we ought to be cautious of ſtopping 'em, unleſs they exceed Bounds; in which caſe they weaken the Body, diſpoſing it to a Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie or Conſumption, and creating an awkward averſion to Women.</p>
                        <p>Periodical, or uſual Piles, or ſuch as proceed from Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, ought to be promoted, and open'd if they be dry. If the Piles flow too copiouſly, they ought to be ſtop'd. If the dry Piles ſeize thoſe who are unacquainted with 'em, or cannot bear the loſs of Blood, they ought to be diſcuſs'd. Chalybeat Medicines are in a manner proper for all theſe purpoſes, by reaſon that the Piles, in what condition ſoever, are for the moſt part either the fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:207638:73"/>or effects of Hypocondriac Diſeaſes. But to anſwer each Indication apart, we ſhall begin with the firſt.</p>
                        <p>For opening the Piles, or promoting their Flux, let the part be firſt fomented with emollient Decoctions, then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Juice of Fig-leaves bruis'd; or the Juice of Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread mix'd with that of Beets; or a Liniment of Aloes, and the Juice of Onyons; or a Suppoſitory of <hi>Hiera Picra,</hi> with the Powder of Coloquintida, Hony, and Ox Gall; or the Decoction of River Crabs in Oyl (eſpecially in caſe of a notable Inflammation, or Heat;) or a Cataplaſin of Pigeons Dung with Staves-acre-ſeeds; or the Juice of Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles mix'd with boyl'd ſtale Urine ſcum'd, and Roſe-water; or (if the <hi>Anus</hi> itch) Juice of Lemons, or Vinegar of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. All theſe Ingredients ought to be put into a leaden Mortar, till they're diſcolour'd. But the moſt effectual way of opening dry Piles, is the Application of Leeches. If they creep into the Gut, a Clyſter of Salt-water will fetch 'em out.</p>
                        <p>Internally the ſame deſign is promoted by reſinous Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives, eſpecially Aloe with Myrrh, or <hi>Elixir Proprietatis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If the Piles flow too copiouſly, they ought to be curb'd, which was our ſecond Indication. For this purpoſe, toſted Rhubarb, Tamarinds, the Conſerve and Syrup of Oak-buds, the Decoction of Maſtic Wood; Syrup of dry Roſes (a common, but very effectual Remedy) the Syrups and Jui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Purſlain, and Quinces; Juice of ſtinging Nettles, given to two or three ounces; the Decoction of Burnet; dead Mens Bones in Powder; Sea-horſe Tooth, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Juice and Syrup of the Ordure of an Aſs, are very proper. Chalybeat Medicines which encounter the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condriac acid, and become as it were Vitriolic, are conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently admirably fitted for this purpoſe. Such are the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Sulphur of Vitriol, or that call'd, <hi>Tinctura Antiphthiſica,</hi> or that of the Vitriol of Steel. A dram of the Pills of <hi>Bdellium</hi> is likewiſe a very proper and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Remedy. <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle and Narcotics are univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known and us'd.</p>
                        <p>Take of Plantan and Purſlain water, of each an ounce and a half; Tincture of the Sulphur of Vitriol, a dram and a half; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> four grains; Syrup of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, ſix grains. Make a Potion.</p>
                        <p>External Repellents are Frankincenſe and Myrrh, or Pitch, for Fumigation; the Spunge call'd <hi>Crepitus Lupi;</hi> the compound Powder of Cork and Mummy; the Powder
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:207638:74"/>of burnt Toads, or of Land Frogs; the fat that drops from a roſted Ele; a Liniment of Soot, yelks of Eggs, and Spiders Webs; Bags quilted with bruis'd Wallnuts and Oaken Leaves, and ſoak'd in Vinegar; all applied to the Fundament. A Girdle of the Leaves of white Hellebor ſew'd in a Clout, with the Powder of Oak bark, is of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent uſe. Dulcify'd Earth of Vitriol beaten up with the Juice of Plantan; the Ointment of Litharge and Tutty mix'd with the Aſhes of Oyſters, are uſeful Liniments. Blooding is of no uſe, excepting the caſe of a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
                        <p>The third Indication is to diſcuſs the dry Piles, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the Pain. The Specifics for this purpoſe, are, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the Apple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in Oyl of ſweet Almonds, for external application; the Decoction of Mullen, and Elder-flowers in Milk; or Mullen-flowers, and Henbane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeds in Water, for Fomentation; or Cataplaſms of their Leaves and Flowers, and the Leaves of Purſlain boyl'd in Milk; Decoctions of the Leaves and Flowers of Toad-flax, and the Flowers of Chamomil in Milk, for Fomentation. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of Toad-flax, two handfuls; Henbane-leaves, half a handful; Oyl of Roſes, Oyl of Mullein, of each three ounces; freſh Butter, five ounces. Boyl them, and expreſs the Liquor, to which add a handful of the Leaves of Toad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flax; then expreſs again, and add the yelks of two Eggs. Make a Liniment, and anoint the part; or add to it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd Oyl of Henbane-ſeeds, and Sugar, or Lead, in caſe of an Inflammation.</p>
                        <p>The Oyl of the Berries of the Herb <hi>Paris</hi> (for Women with Child) or Oyl of Stag-flies, Oyl of Wood-lice, and that of Box-wood, are very much recommended for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unctions.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Mucilages of Fleawort-ſeeds, of Quince-ſeeds, and Linſeeds, prepar'd with Roſe-water, of each an ounce; freſh Butter, an ounce; with the yelks of two Eggs, and Oyl of Roſes; beat them in a leaden Mortar till they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come livid, and make a Liniment of excellent uſe againſt Inflammations of the Piles. The Oyl of Eggs, Spirit of Wine camphoris'd, and Sugar of Lead may be added.</p>
                        <p>The Balſam of Sulphur prepar'd with expreſs'd Oyl of Poppy-ſeeds, or mix'd with Camphyr and Sugar of Lead, or with the Oyl of Eggs, and that of Bricks, is of very good uſe in External Applications. Some put <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:207638:74"/>mix'd with Sugar of Lead, and the Oyl of the Balſam-Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, upon a Clout, and thruſt it into the Fundament.</p>
                        <p>Figwort, Orpine, and Pilewort, are three famous Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fics; they are given inwardly by way of Infuſion, in Ale, or Wine. Their Roots are given alſo in Powder. Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort-roots mix'd with freſh Butter, and kept in a Cellar for fifteen days, yield a noble Liniment. The Juice of Pilewort externally applied, is alſo of excellent uſe.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Roots of Figwort and Pilewort, of each half an ounce; with Oyl of Mullen, make a Liniment.</p>
                        <p>If they become Chronical, let an Iſſue be cut in the Thigh. If they are ulcerated, let fulminatory Gold mix'd with Oyl of ſweet Almonds be applied.</p>
                        <p>Upon the whole, 'twill not be improper to take notice of <hi>Wedelius</hi>'s Caution, <hi>viz.</hi> That Ointments are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the moſt convenient forms, by reaſon that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the Capacity of the Veins, ſtop the Tranſpiration, and augment the Heat.</p>

                  <head>SECT. X. <hi>Of Worms in the</hi> Guts.</head>
                  <p>HAving diſcours'd of the Expulſion of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, we come next to conſider what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural things the Guts may contain, <hi>viz.</hi> Worms. They are either long, or broad, or very ſmall, call'd <hi>Aſcarides</hi> and confin'd to the <hi>Inteſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Rectum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The immediat Cauſe is the ſeed of Worms convey'd into our Bodies. The remote cauſe is putrify'd Crudities in the Stomac and Guts, and the deficiency or weakneſs of the Bile, which is the true ſcare-crow of Worms.</p>
                  <p>The Symptoms are an acid ſmell in the Mouth, ſtinking Spittle copiouſly voided, and with ſome ſqueamiſhneſs; the Excrements in Colour reſembling Cows-dung, the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs of the white of the Eye, or a Jaundice. Sometimes a biting pain ſeizes and diſtends the Belly, eſpecially in a Morning; and the Perſon is troubl'd with night fears, gnaſhing of Teeth, trembling, Convulſions, corroſion of the Gums, Conſumption of the Body; the Face is red, and pale by turns, the Appetit voracious and fierce; the Symptoms are exaſperated by acid bitter Victuals; and mitigated by Milk and ſweet things. The Perſon is moleſted with a dry Cough, and thirſt when his Belly is empty.</p>
                  <p>Broad Worms have this peculiar Symptom, that little things like Gourd-ſeeds are interſpers'd with the Excrements. The <hi>Aſcarides</hi> obſerve the Motions of the Moon: By day they are generally quiet; but from ten a Clock at night, till Morning, they rage. Sometimes they'll corrode the Buttocks and Thighs, and creat Ulcers in the <hi>Anus,</hi> and <hi>Inteſtinum Rectum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The broad ſort are expell'd with the greateſt difficulty. Worms frequently introduce troubleſom Diſeaſes. If in the beginning of a Diſeaſe they throw themſelves out, 'tis a ſign of great malignity within. In the Declenſion, or after Concoction, 'tis look'd upon as a good ſign.</p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:207638:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>In the Diſeaſes of Children, Worms are always ſuſpected. All ſorts of Worms ought to be attack'd during the wane of the Moon. Jalap, Rhubarb, and ſweet Mercury are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Purges. The Specifics are Horſe-Radiſhes, Water-Creſſes, Centory, Wormwood, Peach-flowers, Turnſil, Flowers of St. <hi>John's</hi>-wort, Savin, Water-Germander, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, Zedoary, Onyons, Garlic, Leeks, Myrrh, Aloes, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Hartſhorn; the Decoction of Quickſilver in Onyon or Garlick-water; or Quickſilver beat up with Sugar to a Powder, of which half a dram is a Doſe; the Oyls of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zel and Juniper-woods; the acid Spirits mix'd with fair Water, ſuch as that of Vitriol, of Sulphur, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While the Worms are lodg'd in the ſmall Guts, inject Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Milk, and the Decoctions of Figs, Raiſins, Liquorice, Hony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to invite 'em to come down. If they're arriv'd at the great Inteſtins, kill 'em with Clyſters of the Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Gentian, Wormwood, Graſs-roots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean while apply to the Belly, the Gall of a Bull mix'd with Powder of Coloquintida; or a Cataplaſm of Myrrh, Aloe, Vinegar of Roſes, and Bull's Gall; or Rock Oyl, and Oyl of Hazel-wood, with <hi>Hiera Picra;</hi> or the Ointment of Soubread with Quickſilver.</p>
                  <p>The broad Worms are cur'd by the Juice of Horſe-radiſhes, and the Powder of Jalap with Worm-ſeed. The <hi>Aſcarides</hi> require Suppoſitories of Dutch Cheeſe, or Lard and Hony; and Clyſters of Coloquintida.</p>

                  <head>SECT. XI. <hi>Of Pains in the Guts, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of the</hi> Colic.</head>
                  <p>WHEN the Guts are irritated, and ſuffer wring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Convulſions, they are moleſted with a pain call'd <hi>Gripings.</hi> Sometimes theſe Pains reach only the ſmall Inteſtins, and then their Station is about the Navel, and Center of the Belly, and are much more violent than thoſe in the great Guts; If they range not beyond the <hi>Duodenum</hi> or beginning of the <hi>Jejunum,</hi> they are felt in the Loyns bending towards the right Hypochondrium, and are oftimes miſtaken for Nephritic Pains, or thoſe caus'd by the Convulſions of the meſenteric Nerves, or the Tumors and Ulcers of the <hi>Pancreas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Pains in the great Guts are for the moſt part felt in the Colon, eſpecially that part of it towards the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Belly, upon the left ſide, where 'tis ſtraitned, and incurvated, and conſequently more liable to the ſhocks of Wind, and more apt to ſtop the Circulation of the Excrements, and cauſe their ſwelling up into a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, ſometimes hard, ſometimes ſoft. This Pain and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor is frequently imputed to the Spleen, whereas the Spleen is incapable of any ſhooting, pricking pain, ſuch as this is; its Membran being almoſt inſenſible; and beſides, it lies too low to diſplay its tumor externally. Moreover, this pain is exaſperated by riding immediately after eating; and tho it may be compatible to the <hi>Jejunum</hi> in the left cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, from whence it runs to the Center of the Belly, yet the Colon is its uſual Seat. And ſometimes it veers about to the right ſide of the Belly (upon the outermoſt Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference) where the ſame Colon purſues its Courſe.</p>
                  <p>This laſt mention'd Pain is a Colic, properly ſo call'd; but for ſomuch as the generality of Writers do comprehend the former under the ſame Title, I ſhall not depart from
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:207638:76"/>the uſual Meaſures of preſcribing their Cure without Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, eſpecially conſidering that the ſame is the cauſe of both.</p>
                  <p>Tho the Pains of the Guts be equally cauſed by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions and Contractions, yet the difference of antecedent Cauſes requires Conſideration. Theſe I caſt into two Heads. 1. Some irritating matter provoking the Guts to ſuch Convulſions. 2. The diſorder and uneaſineſs of the Nerves inſerted into the Guts, while they themſelves are faultleſs, as to the matter contain'd in 'em.</p>
                  <p>If the Irritating humor be a viſcous acid mucilage, or hard Excrements faſten'd to the pleats of the Guts, it cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ats a fix'd boring ſort of Pain; its viſcidity ſettles it in one ſtation, and its acidity acts the boring part. This humor cauſes the common Colic. It ſculks for moſt part in that corner of the Colon towards the left ſide of the Belly, where 'tis contracted and bended downwards. It is inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to Hypocondriac acid Conſtitutions, and requires much the ſame ſort of attenuating Medicines. If this acid acquire any notable ſharpneſs, it ſhoots and pricks as it were with a Needle. If the humor be a viſcous matter hatching an impriſon'd acid, it cauſes Wind, and conſequently diſtend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pains; ſuppoſing ſtill that the Inteſtins are moleſted with convulſive Contractions which ſtop the Egreſs, and occaſion the rebounding of the Wind. If the humor be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together viſcid without any acrimony, it cauſes a heavy dull Pain. If the irritating cauſe be Worms, or ſome ſharp ſaltiſh acid, it gnaws the Guts. If the Guts are inflam'd, or the Arteries contracted by the Convulſions, they occaſion a beating ſort of Pain.</p>
                  <p>The Diſorders and Convulſions of the Nerves running from the great Meſenteric <hi>Plexus,</hi> will cauſe tearing, wring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and contracting Pains. They are occaſion'd ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times accidentally, as by Nephritic Pains, and Child-birth, when the Meſenteric <hi>Plexus</hi> being irritated by vertue of its near intercourſe with the Nerves of the Kidnies and the Womb, pulls and contracts both the Stomac and Guts, which it ſupplies with Nerves. At other times they are Retainers to ſome fix'd permanent habitual Cauſe, that tho it lye latent for ſome time, has always an aſcendant in the Body. Theſe are either Scorbutic, or Hypochondriac, or Hyſteric, or Nephritic, and are owing to the Convulſions of the Meſenteric <hi>Plexus,</hi> to which the Inteſtins are annex'd, it being gall'd with an offenſive acid; oftimes the Nerves
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:207638:77"/>of the Throat are likewiſe contracted at the ſame time, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioning a difficult Reſpiration, and a ſort of Suffocation. Of this nature likewiſe are the griping Pains which follow an irregular Cure of Feavers, as being caus'd by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the morbific Matter to the Glandules of the Meſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and the ſubſequent Irritations of its Nerves.</p>
                  <p>Both theſe ſorts of Pains, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe caus'd by a vicious humor in the Inteſtins, and thoſe by a foreign irritation of their Nerves, are equally attended by the ſucceſſive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of Cold and Heat. The Cold proceeds from the Vellication of the Membrans, when 'tis univerſal; or the prevalency of the acid Juice of the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> when it is chiefly felt about the Loyns. The heat from the impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the Spirits, and the acceleration of the Bloods mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or, when the humor is lodg'd in the Duodenum, from the prevalency of the Bile, or its ſtrugling with the Juice of the Pancreas, and accordingly it is moſt perceivable in that place. The Belly is frequently coſtive, by reaſon of the Contractions of the Guts. If it happen to be ſoluble, the Colic from the humors in the Guts is mitigated; but that from a mere irritation receives no benefit. Oftimes the Nerves of the Stomac are influenc'd by the meſenteric Plexus, and a Vomiting inſues.</p>
                  <p>If the Urine be watry, 'tis a Nephritic Colic; if 'tis highly tinctur'd towards the middle, and colour'd in the ſurface, and the <hi>Anus</hi> obſtinatly ſhut, 'tis a Scorbutic Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic; if Reſpiration be difficult, and the Breaſt Perplex'd, 'tis Hyſteric; if the Convulſion of the Inteſtins be attended by a Pain reaching to the Pubes, and Haunch-bone, the Womb is diſorder'd. If the Colic be caus'd by the mere irritation of the Nerves, the Pain is tearing, and not heavy or dull, and the Urine is milky and pale, impregnated with a large Sediment.</p>
                  <p>A Colic is diſtinguiſh'd from ſimple Nephritic Pains by theſe Symptoms. After eating, or the uſe of Aromatics, 'tis mitigated; the Urine undergoes no ſudden Changes, tho a Strangury and high Color may attend the Scorbutic ſort; Clyſters and Evacuations give eaſe, and the heavy Pain does not inceſſantly moleſt the Loyns: Now the Symptoms of Nephritic Pains are directly contrary to theſe.</p>
                  <p>The Cauſes of Colics are already hinted at. In general, ſome noxious acid either irritats the Nerves, being ſeated in the <hi>Plexus</hi> of the Meſentery, or reigning in the Guts. The Pancreatic Juice is of that nature. The Bile is of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:207638:77"/>diluting quality, and do's not of it ſelf cauſe Colic Pains, unleſs it become black, ruſty, and green, as in the Bilious Colics. The Remote Cauſes are whatever promotes Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in the Stomac or Guts, increaſes or exalts an Acid, or Creates an uneaſineſs to the Guts and Membrans of the Body. Of theſe more under the Head of Iliac Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>A Bilious Colic, or that proceeding from humors in the Guts is of a meek Character, unleſs it be flatulent. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it Degenerats into Ulcers. If the body be very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtive and the Anus retracted, 'tis a fatal ſymptom and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends an Iliac. Hoarſeneſs and Vomiting are bad Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms. Convulſive Colics, eſpecially the Scorbutic Kind, are very dangerous and obſtinat, and frequently end in Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepſies, or ſome ſuch diſorder of the Head.</p>
                  <p>The Cure is endeavour'd both during the Paroxyſm, and after its diſappearance. In the Paroxyſm, the Indications are to allay the Irritation of the Guts, correct and evacuate the peccant Matter, if the Colic proceed from vicious Humors, and redreſs the Diſorders of the Nerves, if it be Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</p>
                  <p>In order to compaſs theſe Ends, 1. The Belly ought to be kept open with Clyſters, eſpecially if the Colic proceed from Vicious Humors in the Guts, or if the Great Guts be their Habitation. If the Small Guts are affected, gentle Lax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atives taken by the Mouth, are much preferable. In Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive Colics we may inject emollient Anodyn Clyſters of Turpentine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But when a Humor, or harden'd Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure prevails in the great Guts, we may add ſharp Purging Ingredients. As,</p>
                  <p>Take of the Decoction of Peaſe Eight Ounces, Infuſion of <hi>Crocus Metallorum</hi> two or three OUnces, Lenitive E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuary, or Oyl of Olives an ounce. Mix for a Clyſter. When the great Guts are afflicted by hard Excrements, ſome add the Extract of the greater Common Spurge, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Antimonial Infuſion. The Smoak of Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co is alſo proper for the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>For Convulſive Colics, Take of the Emollent Decoction one Pound, Turpentine diſſolv'd with the Yelk of an Egg, two, three or four ounces, ſtrain'd Hony ſix or eight Drams. Make a Clyſter. The Oyl of Linſeed and Rape-Oyl are likewiſe very proper. For old Perſons an Anodyn Clyſter may be prepar'd of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> VVine and Oyl of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momil.</p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:207638:78"/>
                  <p>For a Flatulent Colic; Take of Bay Leaves, a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; Chamomil flowers a handful and a half; Angelica, or Lovage Roots, ſix Drams; The four leſſer hot Seeds, of each two Drams; Boyl them in fair Water. To ten Ounces of the ſtrain'd Liquor add Electuary of Bayberries, ſix Drams; <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle, one or two Drams; Diſtill'd Oyls of Angelica, Caraways, Cumminſeed, and Bayberries, of each three or four drops. With the Yelk of one Egg; Make two Clyſters, to be injected at two ſeveral times, by reaſon of the wind diſturbing the Injection. Or,</p>
                  <p>Take of the Carminative Decoction, ſix Ounces; Man's Urine, four Ounces; Yeſt, a Dram; Common Salt, a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; Hony of Roſes, an Ounce. Make a Clyſter in flatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Colics.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of the Diſeaſe, Gentle Emollient, Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyn Clyſters are not improper in any Colic. As, take of Henbane Leaves, a handful; Boyl them in Milk; To ten Ounces of the Decoction, add an Ounce of the Honey of Roſes. Mix for a Clyſter.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards when we have diſcover'd that vicious matter, or hard Excrements are Lodg'd in the great Guts, we may preſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> be Emollient Clyſters ſharpen'd with Sal Gem, and if theſe prove ineffectual add ſharp Purgatives as above. If the Anus be much retracted, and threaten an Iliac, let Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters be ſparingly us'd, as likewiſe in all true Convulſive Colics.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the Inteſtines are much Contracted, either by fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Convulſions or vicious matter within, proper Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires ought to be avoided; for they promote the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Lock up the Excrements cloſer. In this caſe Whey, or an Ounce of the Oyl of ſweet Almonds, with <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wine and <hi>Sperma Caeti,</hi> are more effectual than the ſtrongeſt Purgatives. If the Guts be inflamed, all Laxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives whatſoever are Pernicious. If the Colic proceed from a tenacious viſcid humor, and be attended by a heavy Boring pain, Purgatives mix'd with attenuating Ingredients are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable, tho rather after the Fit has made ſome progreſs, and the Symptoms are a little abated, than juſt in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, eſpecially if the Pain be very Violent. The ſafer way is to begin with Emollient Abſtergent Preſcriptions, ſuch as that of the Oyl of Almonds and Wine, and <hi>Sperma Caeti;</hi> and then after ſome time preſcribe thus.</p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:207638:78"/>
                  <p>Take of Mint Water, an ounce and a half; Cinnamon Water, half an ounce; Gum Ammoniac diſſolv'd in Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, half a dram; Tartar Vitriolated, fifteen Grains; Scammony Sulphurated, and Troches Alhandal, of each two Grains; Solutive Syrup of Roſes, or of Apples, half an ounce. Make a Potion for a Colic, proceeding from a tenacious acid humor in the Guts. In the Declenſion of the Fit, 'tis expedient to exhibit ſweet Mercury with the Pills of <hi>Hera</hi> with <hi>Agaric,</hi> for diſſolving and waſhing off the remains of the viſcous Acid. Or, if in the beginning of the Fit it be ſafe or convenient to Purge, let <hi>Laudanum Opiatum</hi> be added. As,</p>
                  <p>Take of Gum Ammoniac diſſolv'd in Vinegar, a dram; Diagrydium ſix Grains; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> four or five Grains. Mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Fulminatory Gold is likewiſe a proper Ingredient. After the Paroxyſm is over Sudorifics and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives mix'd together are not improper.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If the Stomac and upper Guts are ſtuff'd with pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant matter, Vomits are very uſeful. If the pain bear downwards, they are very Pernicious.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Narcotics, eſpecially Hyſteric Laudanum, are very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Convulſive Colics and ſuch as proceed from a thin fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry humor. They are given in the beginning and during the increaſe of the fit, while the Patient has yet ſtrength ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. In caſe of a viſcous acid humor they are not ſo proper till the Guts be cleans'd by Purgatives, unleſs the Violence of Symptoms require 'em. The better way is to mix 'em with the Purgatives, and exhibit 'em alſo after Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. Or to give 'em before Purging, ſo as that they have not finiſh'd their office till the ſucceeding Purge joyn 'em.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Stomac and Feet ought to be well Arm'd againſt Cold; and all Cold Liquors avoided; for ſometimes they cauſe a Colic, and in that caſe a large draught of Juniper Water is a Sovereign Remedy. 'Tis true, there are ſome Inſtances of Colics cur'd by drinking Cold Water, which perhaps relaxats the contracted Guts. But 'tis an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental caſe, and ought not to be look'd upon as a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. When the Belly is open'd, if the Symptoms do not diſappear, let Aromatic Ingredients be us'd; as being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably fitted for tempering the acid, attenuating the viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid matter, diſcuſſing Wind, and fortifying the Nerves againſt Convulſions. Such are, Male Speedwell, Chamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil, its Decoction in Water, or its Oyl taken inwardly,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:207638:79"/>Clary, Orange Peel, Zedoary, Garlic, Gentian, Elecampane, Wormwood, the four large hot-ſeeds, Caſtor, Sulphur, Horſe Dung and Stones; Spirit of Sal-armoniac, Spirit of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle Camphoris'd, Spirit of Tartar, Spirit of Hartſhorn, the Carminative Spirit de tribus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some commend the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Wormwood, Elecampane Roots, and Orange Peel, with mithridat.</p>
                  <p>Take of Chamomil and Elder flowers; Leaves of Mint, and dry'd Rue, of each three handfuls; freſh Juniper ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries two ounces and a half, Bay berries Peel'd, ſix drams; Cummin Seeds, an ounce; Anis and Fennel Seed, of each half an ounce; Aromatic Calamus, an ounce and a half; The yellow part of Orange Peel, three ounces; Cinnamon ſix drams, Zedoary, three drams; Pound them well, and ſprinkle 'em with ſix drams of rectify'd Spirit of Wine. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe them in a ſufficient Quantiy of Spirit of Wine, not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectify'd, for the ſpace of twelve hours over a gentle heat of Sand; then Diſtil ſlowly. Doſe a ſpoonful or two.</p>
                  <p>Take of the Waters of Aniſed, and Chamomil flowers, of each two ounces; Cinnamon Water, an ounce; Spirit of Zedoary, half an ounce; Dulcify'd Spirit of Nitre, two drams; Diſtill'd Oyl of Anis, ſix drops; <hi>Laudanum Opia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> two Grains; Syrup of Orange Peel, an ounce. Make a Potion to be taken by ſpoonfuls in Bilious Colics.</p>
                  <p>Take of the Waters of Chamomil flowers, Mint and Penny Royal, of each an ounce; Eſſence of Caſtor, two or three drams; Spirit of Hartſhorn Succinated, or Spirit of Sal-ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac, a dram and a half; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> three Grains; Syrup of Mugwort, an ounce. Mix for two or three Doſes in Convulſive Colics.</p>
                  <p>Take of Chamomil Water, two drams; Mint Water, an ounce; Eſſence of <hi>Opium,</hi> half a dram; Jaw bone of a Pike, a dram; Volatil Salt of Hartſhorn, fifteen Grains; Syrup of Fennel, three drams. Mix and give a ſpoonful now and then, in Convulſive Colics.</p>
                  <p>Take of the flowers of Sulphur, two drams; Jaw bone of a Pike, a dram; Diſtill'd Oyls of Caraways, Cummin ſeed and Fennel ſeed, of each four drops; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> four Grains, Make a Powder for three, four, or five Doſes, in the Colics that proceed from humors.</p>
                  <p>In Nephritic Colics, Pills of Turpentin are very proper. If the Gripings are attended by a burning heat the dulci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd Spirit of Nitre; If by a Coldneſs, the fix'd ſalts, and abſorbent Powders, are uſeful.</p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:207638:79"/>
                  <p>Take of the ſhavings of Ivory, two ſcruples; Prepar'd red Coral, and Crabs Eyes, of each a ſcruple; Seal'd Earth, twelve Grains; the Diſtill'd Oyl of Orange Peel, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd Oyls of Anis, Caraways, Fennel, and Zedoary, of each a drop. Make a Powder for two Doſes.</p>
                  <p>Take of Caſtor, half a ſcruple; Volatil Salt of Amber, five Grains; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> a Grain or two, Make a Powder for Convulſive Colics. Or,</p>
                  <p>Take of the Tincture of Tartar, half an ounce; Eſſence of Gum Ammoniac, three drams; Eſſence of Myrrh Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taris'd, a dram and a half. Mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Doſe fifty drops. <hi>Elixyr Proprietatis,</hi> Eſſence of Caſtor, or that of <hi>Opium</hi> may be added by turns. Pills of the Extract of Caſtor, and that of Venice Treacle, mix'd with ſome convenient Oyl are very proper. The Decoction, Eſſence, Powder and Oyl of Orange Peel, (eſpecially in a ſtrangury) and all Preparations from Clary; are of Sovereign uſe in all Colics. The flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of ſulphur are of unknown Vertue; if mix'd with Myrrh, or Diſtill'd Oyls. Spirit of Nitre well rectify'd with Spirit of Wine diſtill'd from aromatic Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, is an incomparable thing in all hot Colics. 'Tis given with the Decoction of Elecampane Roots for a Vehicle. The Oyl or Spirit of Turpentin, digeſted with Juniper Berries and Flowers of St. <hi>Johns</hi> wort (which by the way are poſſeſs'd of a rich Oyl) is given againſt the Colics caus'd by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors in the Guts, to a ſcruple, with wonderful ſucceſs. The Carminative Spirit made of Nitre Tartar and Spirit of Urine, given to half a dram in ſome warm Vehicle, is likewiſe much applauded. The Powder of Horſe's Stones given to a dram in Lilly Convally Water with a little Saffron; the ſhavings of a Bull's Pizzle given to a ſcruple in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wine, the Powder of Soot mix'd with Vinegar, or its Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, are all approv'd Remedies. Sugar of Lead is excellent where acidity prevails. As the juice of Horſe Dung, or that of other Beaſts, mix'd with warm Ale, is inferior to no Medicine in that Caſe. After taking any of theſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines the Patient ought to be very quiet, and make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to ſweat.</p>
                  <p>If a Colic tend to a Palſy of the Guts, let ſharp Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters be injected; and Volatil Salts exhibited, ſuch as that of Urine, Spirit of Hartſhorn or of Sal-armoniac, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Volatil Spirit of Tartar, or which is yet more Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil, the Spirit Diſtill'd from the Dregs of Wine. In a ſcorbutic Colic let Volatil Salts and Antiſcorbutic Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:207638:80"/>be added. In a Colic caus'd by any External error, Laxatives mix'd. With Abſorbents are proper. If cold or Drinking occaſion it, give Pepper and Spirit of Wine.</p>
                  <p>As for External Applications againſt Colic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> and afterwards cover it with a hot Brick. The fot of a Wild Cat and Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet is much approv'd for this uſe. As alſo Galbanum melted and mix'd with the Diſtill'd Oyls of Spike and Amber. Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters made of Tacamahac, Balſam of Peru, or that of Bay berries with that of Tobacco; Cataplaſms of Horſe Dung with Oyl of Rue; And Quilted Bags of Milletſeeds, or of Anodyn and Aromatic Ingredients; are likewiſe applied to the belly with good ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>Take of the Oyls of Bays, of Dill and of Chamomil, of each half an ounce; Galbanum, a dram; Diſtill'd Oyl of Amber, half a dram; Diſtill'd Oyls of Caraways, Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min and Fennel, of each half a ſcruple. Make a Liniment. The Oyl of Orange Peel, the Diſtill'd Oyl of Angelica, and the Oyl of Caſtor, or Powders of Caſtor are alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Ingredients. The Oyl of Soap and white Rock Oyl, are of excellent uſe Externally in all Convulſive Colics.</p>
                  <p>Take of the tops of Henbane, and Elder Flowers, of each two handfuls; Chamomil flowers three or four handfuls; freſh Juniper berries, two ounces. Make a Quilted Bag to be infus'd in hot Wine, or boyl'd in Goats Milk, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Belly, and frequently reiterated, eſpecially in Scorbutic Colics.</p>
                  <p>Take of the Leaves of Bays and Rue, of each three handfuls; Tops of Dill and leſſer Centory, flowers of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Chamomil, Elder flowers, of each half a handful; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica and Lovage Roots, of each two ounces; Bay berries, an ounce; Juniper berries, half an ounce; the four greater hot ſeeds, of each two drams. Boyl them in Wine for a Bag. Some chooſe to apply Bags of Oats, Juniper berries, and Coriander ſeeds. Others apply a little Puppy to the Belly.</p>
                  <p>So much for the cure of a Colic fit. After the fit is over, let Diuretic and Garminative Medicines be us'd. The ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Steel with the juice of Apples, the Spirit of Sal-ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac, and, to robuſt Conſtitutions, the Solar Liquor of Steel, are then very uſeful.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THE Caul and Guts are wrap'd into the <hi>Peritonaeum.</hi> If this Membran be relaxated or broke, they fall out upon the Infirm Part, either ſeparately, or both together. The Guts, which are liable to this Eruption, are the <hi>Jejunum</hi> and <hi>Ileum.</hi> The great Guts are ſecure from that danger, as being more firmly faſtned. This Relaxation of the <hi>Perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum,</hi> happens for the moſt part in one of its two Proceſſes, the one ſurrounding the Umbilical, the other the Spermatic Veſſels. The Burſting at the Navel is ſometimes caus'd by hard Labour in Child-birth. Vomiting, Jumping, crying aloud, carrying of heavy Burthens, Coughing, Sneezing, violent Purgations, or whatever divides or ſtretches the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bran of the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> are the General Cauſes of all Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                     <p>Children, whoſe Membrans are tender, and moſt expos'd to Violence, are very obnoxious to this Diſeaſe. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Infirmity is Hereditary, or produc'd by Internal Cauſes, but withal very rarely. If the Proceſs of the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritonaeum</hi> ſurrounding the Spermatic Veſſels, be dilated, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Caul, or the Guts, or both, fall down either upon the Groyn, or into the Cod. If the Membran be quite broke, they ſtop about the Muſcles of the Groyn. But if it be only dilated, they trace its Progreſs to the Cod.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:207638:81"/>Sometimes, but very rarely, this burſting falls out upon the ſides of the belly, or upon the Loyns, or thro a Breach in the Womb. And Surgeons ought to be very cautious that they be not impos'd upon by it, under the appearance of an Ulcer in thoſe unwonted Places. The Stones ſometimes are drawn into the Groyn, and Reſemble a Rupture, and are oft times taken either for that, or an Impoſthume.</p>
                     <p>A Rupture therefore is a ſoft Tumor, ſometimes decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, ſometimes increaſing. If it be Recent, it diſappears when the Patient lies on his Back, and returns when he ſtands upright. For the moſt part 'tis Painleſs, and eaſy to put up, unleſs the Gut be inflam'd, or moleſted with Wind, or harden'd Excrements. And beſides, it increaſes, if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient cough. By theſe Signs it is diſtinguiſh'd from Bubo's, or the Teſticle ſticking in the Paſſage.</p>
                     <p>If the Gut be irritated either externally by Cold, Bruiſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or Internally by Wind, hard Excrements, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Iliac or Colic Pains inſue and are very fatal; as likewiſe Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, or Gangrenes, or Suppuration of the Gut. In adult People, 'tis a difficult matter to cure a Rupture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A Hic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cough following a painful and ſudden Burſting is a fatal ſymptom. If it be caus'd by cold, 'tis very dangerous.</p>
                     <p>The cure is perform'd by putting up the Caul or Gut, fortifying it in its proper Station, and healing the Breach, or contracting the Width of the <hi>Peritonaeum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Purgatives are pernicious. If the great Guts are moleſted with Wind, or the Belly coſtive, let Clyſters be injected. Flatulency promotes and exaſperates the Diſeaſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to be particularly ſubdu'd by Carminative and Precipitating Medicines. In putting up the Gut, we ought to handle it very tenderly, and very ſeldom, for fear of Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritation, and place the Patient's Feet higher than his Head. All things us'd either Internally or Externally, ought to be Lukewarm. Solid Victuals ought to be avoided, and Liquid Food chiefly us'd. If the Gut be hard, let it be Fomented with Emollient Decoctions; for the hardneſs proceeds for the moſt part from its Diſtention and Convulſive Poſture, rather than hard Excrements, which are ſeldom found in the ſmall Guts. When the part is handled, let the Surgeons Hands, or Fingers be anointed with Oyl of Chamomil, and Oyl of St. <hi>John</hi>'s wort, with a few Drops of ſome Carmina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Oyl.</p>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:207638:81"/>
                     <p>If it be difficult to put up the Gut, let the following me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod be obſerv'd; Internally, Exhibit the Decoction of the greater Four hot Seeds in VVine. Externally, apply a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſm of Sheeps Dung boyl'd in Goats Milk, and Foment with the Decoction, adding to it a little of the Spirit of VVine, in order to diſcuſs the VVind and Hardneſs, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the Pain. Some apply the hot Caul of a gelded Lamb, and with good ſucceſs. The Hardneſs, VVind and Pain are likewiſe mitigated by Fomenting with Decoctions of Emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lient and Carminative Ingredients. Or Clyſters of the ſame Ingredients may be injected, that ſo the great Guts being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptied, any irritating matter in the ſmall ones may have the eaſier paſſage. Let Plaiſters alſo be applied to the Loyns to oblige the meſentery to draw back the fallen Gut. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of Gum Ammoniac, <hi>Galbanum</hi> and <hi>Sagapenum,</hi> of each three drams; Turpentin and Virgin VVax, two or ſix drams; Arſenical Loadſtone two drams, and fifteen Grains; Roots of Cuckowpint, a dram. Diſſolve the Gums in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, and boyl them to the conſiſtence of a Plaiſter to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the other Powders. Apply the Plaiſter to the Loyns. Some commend the fat of a Bear, or of a Hedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hog, for the ſame uſe.</p>
                     <p>If all theſe means prove ineffectual, a Surgeon muſt open the place and put up the Gut, and then heal the wound.</p>
                     <p>After the Gut is put into its proper ſtation, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to confirm it and the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> by Internal and External Means. The former are the Vulnerary Decoctions, eſpecially thoſe of Rupturewort and Thorowax. The Seed of Carden-Creſſes is of Excellent uſe given inwardly in Powder with Red VVine, or by way of Decoction, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Externally, being beaten up with the Yelk of an Egg, or form'd into a Plaiſter with Caran and boyl'd Turpentin. The Oyl of Lizzards is of ſingular uſe for External Uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The ſalted Skins of Eels, or of Serpents, boyl'd up with Lees to the conſiſtence of a Plaiſter, or Plaiſters made of Pitch, Maſtic, Caran, Dragons-blood, Bole-armenic, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or of Roſin, Pitch and Powder of Bricks; or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Plaiſters of <hi>Rulandus</hi>'s <hi>Diaſulphuris,</hi> the Rupture-Plaiſter and Pitch mix'd in equal Quantities; are all recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for outward application. Some anoint the Part with Balſam of Sulphur, and the Oyl of the Yelks of Eggs. But others reject all Oyly Ingredients, as being too Laxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and order the application of Clouts dipp'd into diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Vinegar, in which Lytharge is diſſolv'd, and after that
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:207638:82"/>a Plaiſter of the Gum of Black-Cherry-Tree, diſſolv'd in Oyl of St. <hi>John</hi>'s-wort, and mix'd with Frankincenſe and Maſtic. During the time of applying theſe Plaiſters, let the Belly be kept open, and a Truſs kept conſtantly about it, and never remov'd but when the Patient lies on his Back.</p>

                     <p>THE <hi>Inteſtinum Rectum</hi> is ſometimes ſtretch'd out ſo far, that the Retracting Muſcles are not able to draw it in.

                  <head>SECT. XIII. <hi>Of the Incumbrances of the Chyle, in its Paſſage from the</hi> Guts.</head>
                  <p>THE Chyle being duly ſeparated and purify'd in the Guts, ought to enter the Milky Veſſels, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed thro the Glandules of the Meſentery to the common Receptacle, where it is diluted with the Lymph of the inferior Branches; and from thence continues its progreſs thro the Conduit of the Breaſt, to the Axillary Vein, where it joyns the Lymph of the upper Region.</p>
                  <p>This natural motion is oftimes anticipated by tenacious humors guarding the entry of the <hi>Vaſa Lactea,</hi> or Scars following the Corroſion of a Dyſentery, or Looſeneſs; or interrupted by its own viſcidity, or ſlime ſqueez'd into its Veſſels from the Guts and afterwards congeal'd; of which we have a plain Inſtance in the Caſe of drinking cold Liquors after a violent hot Exerciſe; for as much as the heat melts the ſlime, and the motion drives it into the Veſſels, and the ſudden arrival of cold Liquor cuts off its retreat, by cauſing its Coagulation; ſo that it either ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nats, or proceeds with the Chyle to the Blood, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praves its Craſis.</p>
                  <p>This viſcidity or crudity of the Chyle, or of the Humor its Companion, is the true cauſe of all Chronical Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, falſly imputed by the Ancients to Obſtructions, or contrary Qualities of the Bowels. That there are Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, I do not deny: Some in the Blood Veſſels, cauſing Inflammations: Others in the Lymphatic (or perhaps thoſe of the Chyle) cauſing the rupture of the Veſſels, and effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Lymph upon the Cavities of the Body. And others again in the Bowels, appearing in the form of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſthumes and Schirrus's. But theſe are rather the effect, than cauſe of Chronical Diſeaſes. That ſtagnation of the Liquors in their reſpective Veſſels, is occaſion'd by their viſcidity. The viſcidity is caus'd by acid Crudities attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:207638:83"/>the Chyle, and debauching the Blood and Lymph. Moreover, the proneneſs of Impoſthumes to ſuppurate, and that of Schirrus's to become Ganeers, are ſolid proofs of their being caus'd by a viſcous acid. And, as to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy of the Bowels, 'tis inconſiſtent with the Laws of Circulation. The Blood and Spirits are equally the cauſe of heat all over the Body, if all the parts be equally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> with Heat and Inflammation, while the others retain their cooler Temperature. But it plainly appears, that theſe effects are not owing to any Radical Antipathy in the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Bowels, but the occaſional unequal Diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the viſcous acid Particles.</p>
                  <p>It remains therefore to be concluded upon, that the acid Crudity of the Chyle, impreſs'd upon it in the firſt Paſſages, is the natural and obvious cauſe of Chronical Diſtempers; and that Obſtructions may be effected by the long duration of theſe Diſtempers, but cannot claim the priviledge of being their Cauſes. This Hypotheſis will be ſet in a clearer light by ſurveying the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms, and the Method of Curing theſe Chronical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers. The former are acid Belchings, Wind, loſs of Appetit, Gripings, and noiſe in the Guts; incident heat and Inflammation, Looſeneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the natural Progeny of an acid Crudity. And as touching the latter, the whole Circle of Specifics is generally made to center in an aperient Vertue. Now the Preparations of Steel and Lead do juſtly lead the Van of this numberleſs Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue. And how theſe aſtringent Medicines ſhould be intitled to an opening Vertue, all the <hi>Poſſe</hi> of Writers is at a loſs to explain. Whereas 'tis an obvious Soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that theſe metallin Particles ſuck up and incounter the acid Crudity, and transform it into a vitriolic Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete, which is afterwards evacuated under the form of black Excrements. So that it opens or unlocks the Paſſages only indirectly, by ſubduing the hoſtil In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truder.</p>
                  <p>Antiſcorbutic volatil ſalin Medicines and Gums are likewiſe us'd. Now they attinuat the viſcous Humor, precipitat the rank acid, fortifie the Stomac (the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:207638:84"/>ſource of the Evil) and whet the Bile. And here by the way, 'twill not be improper to take notice that the Eſſences commonly prepar'd from volatil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſcorbutic Herbs, as the Eſſence of Scurvygraſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> fall ſhort of the original vertue of their Herbs, as contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only the volatil Salt, ſtrip'd of the fix'd Salt, which withal is very uſeful. Upon which account I prefer the Quinteſſences made of the Oyl, and both the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, one prepar'd by Fermentation, and the other by Putrefaction; Theſe two being mix'd with the diſtill'd Oyl by long Digeſtion and frequent Cohobation. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, all Antiſcorbutic Spirits prepared by Fermentation, ought to be frequently cohobated in order to extract the fixed Alcalin Salt. Tartar alſo is a great Specific in theſe Caſes. But its Cream is too acid. Let it be mix'd with half the quantity of Salt of Tartar, diſſolv'd in warm water, after Fermentation filtrated, and ſet to evaporat. Thus its Acidity is conquer'd. Its volatil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or rather that drawn from the Dregs of Wine; or the Carminative Spirit prepar'd from Nitre, Tartar, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine; and all volatil Preparations of Tartar are of wonderful efficacy in clearing the firſt Paſſages, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the Digeſtive Ferment, and conquering the acid of Wine, that we in theſe Countries are ſo obnoxious to.</p>
                  <p>In the Animal Province, Man's Urine given to drink, and all urinous Spirits and Salts, eſpecially the Spirit of Salarmoniac prepar'd with Quick-lime, are noted anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acids in all Chronical Diſtempers. The Spirit of Ants, and that of Earth-worms, are famous Anti-ſcorbutics. Of the Mineral Family, Steel is the Head. It ought not to be much impregnated with an acid, otherwiſe it will not diſſolve in the Body. The beſt way of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it is either in crude Powder, or by way of extract, taken from its Infuſion in the Juice of Apples, Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or of Tamarinds; or a Tincture taken from the ſame with Spirit of Scurvygraſs. The Tincture of Steel, prepar'd with Spirit of Bread, is likewiſe a proper form. Its Crocus is beſt prepar'd by ſprinkling it with Juice of Cichory, and expoſing it to the Sun. Next to Steel is Lead, eſpecially its Sugar, and the Antiphthiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Tincture, prepar'd from it and vitriol of Steel with Spirit of Wine.</p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:207638:84"/>
                  <p>From theſe Premiſes we infer, that the Cauſe of all Chronical Diſtempers, is a viſcous acid Crudity, either bred in the Stomac, or caus'd by the vicious Efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies of the Gall, and the Juice of the Pancreas in the Guts. Upon which Account all Stomachical, attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating, anti-acid Medicines are the true Antidote of theſe Diſeaſes. And whoever attempts to cure 'em, without a ſpecial regard to the Stomac and firſt Paſſages, ſhoots ſhort of his Mark.

                  <p>THUS far we have conſider'd the Chyle in its ſeparat State. It remains now, to ſurvey its ſtate of Complication with the Blood. The mix'd Maſs of Blood and Chyle is carried from the Axillary Vein to the deſcending Trunc of the <hi>Vena Cava;</hi> from thence 'tis convey'd to the right Ventricle of the Heart; and before its entry into the left Ventricle, is thrown into the Lungs by the <hi>Vena Arterioſa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lungs are a heap of little Bladders joyn'd by a ſimple Membran, endow'd with moving Fibres, and require to be dilated before the Blood can have admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This Dilatation is perform'd by the Air and Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. The Midriff, together with the Subclavian and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercoſtal Muſcles, inlarge the Capacity of the Breaſt; upon which, there being no <hi>Vacuum,</hi> the Air crouds into the Lungs, and diſtends 'em to fill up the void ſpace. The Lungs being thus diſtended, the blood empties it ſelf into 'em; and by vertue of the univerſal Salt of the Air, its Maſs is diſſolv'd, rarify'd, volatilis'd, and freed of its Steams. This Admiſſion of Air, or Dilatation of the Lungs, is call'd Inſpiration. And the Expulſion of it, or ſucceſſive compreſſion of the Lungs forwarding the Blood to the left Ventricle of the Breaſt, is ſtil'd Expiration; the complex Action bearing the title of Reſpiration.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>SUffocation is a denying of admiſſion to the Air. The Cauſe may relate either to the Paſſages thro which the Air is to paſs, or to the Lungs that are to receive it, or to the Muſcles that ought to dilate the Breaſt.</p>
                     <p>The Paſſages are embaraſſed by external Ligatures, which if they be ſuddenly put on, extinguiſh all manner of Senſe in an inſtant; by being fill'd with Water, or drowning; by Tumors and Inflammations in the Neighborhood of the Wind-pipe; by ſwallowing bulky things that ſtick in the Gullet and preſs the Wind-pipe, or bear down the Epiglottis; by forcing things into the Wind-pipe by laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or ſpeaking in the time of eating; by Hairs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſticking to the Epiglottis, and diſturbing its motion; or by a large Polypus in the Noſe, ſpreading its Branches to the Throat.</p>
                     <p>After ſtrangling we endeavour to bring the Perſon to life by Blood-letting, pouring down ſpirituous Liquors, and rubbing the Joynts. If the Suffocation is caus'd by being under Water, we hang up the Perſon by the Heels, that the Water may run out; then apply a Toaſt ſoak'd in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine, and exhibit Sudorifics, or ſometimes a gentle Vomit. If any bulky thing ſtick in the Throat, give 'em a blow on the Back, and exhibit Oyl of ſweet Almonds, or Caſſia. If it ſtick in the Wind-pipe, Coughing, Sneezing, and Vomiting will bring it up. If a Bone ſtick in the Gullet, let it be brought up by an Inſtrument, or apply a ſuppurating Cataplaſm, or exhibit a Vomit. A narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Paſſage caus'd by <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> is cur'd by the Mucilage of Quinces.</p>
                     <p>A ſudden Suffocation affecting the Lungs immediately, is caus'd by Narcotic Sulphurous Steams of New Wine or Ale; new Plaiſtering, Coal-Pits, and other Mineral Fumes, which deſtroy the Airy Spirit that ſhould ferment the Blood, and ſo cauſe its Stagnation in the Lungs, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the animal Spirits; producing Apoplexies, Carus's,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:207638:86"/>and many diſmal Symptoms. For Cure, let the Perſon be carried into free Air, the Mouth open'd, and Wind Artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally procur'd; let a liquid Vomit mix'd with the Eſſence of Caſtor, or Apoplectic-waters, be thrown down the Throat. Let Vinegar, in which Caſtor is infus'd, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by Spoonfuls. If the Perſon be Plethoric, open a Vein. Apply outwardly Epithema's of Vinegar to the <hi>Scrotum</hi> and Teſticles. Blow Sneezing Powders into the Noſtrils, and rub the Temples and Noſtrils with little Bags of Marjoram and Fennel-Flower-ſeeds infus'd in Vinegar. Note, Tho Vinegar be of admirable Efficacy againſt the Gas or Steams of Vegetables, yet 'tis not proper againſt a Mineral Gas.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly. The Cauſes of Suffocation relating to the Muſcles of the Breaſt, are their Paralytic Apoplectic Condition, or Convulſions of the Larynx, occaſion'd by the Diſorder of the Nerves of the <hi>Par Vagum,</hi> and thoſe of the Interco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal Branch, as in the caſe of Hyſteric and Hypochondriac fits, Poyſon, or eating a ſort of ſtrangling Muſhrooms, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Cure is perform'd by Eſſence of Caſtor, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil Salt of Amber, Camphyr, Opiats, and ſuch Medicines as we uſe againſt Hyſteric and Epileptic Fits.

                        <p>AN Aſthma is a frequent difficult Reſpiration, attended by a perplexity in the Breaſt; and ſometimes a Cough and Snoring. Sometimes 'tis ſo violent, that the Patient can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not breathe unleſs he ſtand upright; and then 'tis call'd, <hi>Orthopnaeia.</hi> The general Cauſe of all Aſthma's is the Conſtriction of the Veſicles of the Lungs. The particular Cauſes are various.</p>
                        <pb n="153" facs="tcp:207638:86"/>
                        <p>Some Aſthma's are moiſt, proceeding from vicious Matter, provoking the Lungs and Wind-pipe to Contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and frequently attended by coughing, ſpitting and ſnor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, tho not always. Others are Dry, occaſion'd by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions of the Organs of Reſpiration, or dryneſs of the Lungs, without the influence of any deprav'd humor.</p>
                        <p>The Matter that gives riſe to the moiſt ſort, is frequently lodg'd in the Stomac and firſt Paſſages, and by diſtending them, preſſes the Lungs and Diaphragm; Hence wind and acid Crudities, ſuch as Hypocondriac or Scorbutic Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are generally lyable to, frequently cauſe a difficult Breathing in a Morning when they lye upon their backs in Bed: Or after eating, eſpecially at Night; or after Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wine. Dropſies alſo diſtending the Muſcles of the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Crouding the Blood with ſerum, may occaſion a difficulty of Breathing.</p>
                        <p>If the matter lodge in the Lungs, 'tis either Originally bred within 'em, or transfer'd thither from other Parts. If it be bred there, it proceeds from the Depravation of the Nutritious Juice of the Lungs, and Wind Pipe; occaſion'd by Mineral Steams, or Vicious Air, or the Viſcidity and Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Lymph that waters 'em. For if their Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Juice be perverted, it degenerats into a tartareous, hard, or otherwiſe Noxious matter. Impoſthumes and Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in the Lungs may alſo be reckon'd as Cauſes of this Kind of Aſthma.</p>
                        <p>If the Peccant humor be not bred in the Lungs, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds either from ſerum thrown upon 'em or the Bronchia, or Blood ſtagnating within 'em. The former cauſe takes place, ſometimes in the Declenſions of Feavers, or when the Pores of the Body are ſtop'd; The latter in a Redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy of Blood, Suppreſſion of the Terms or Piles, in Cachectic Perſons whoſe Blood is Glutinous and Stuff'd with Crudities, and conſequently requires more time for Rarefaction in the Lungs; in the caſe of ſudden fear, or Drinking of Cold Water immediatly after the Blood has been rarify'd by a Violent heat. Any Acid matter that's apt to Coagulat the Blood may alſo produce the ſame effect.</p>
                        <p>As for dry Aſthma's; They may proceed from a preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural form of the Back and Breaſt, or from Stones and Schirrus's in the Lungs: But the more Notable Cauſe is the Convulſions of the Organs of Reſpiration, eſpecially the Diaphragm, occaſion'd by the diſorders of the lower Belly, as in Hyſteric or Hypochondriac Fits; the Contorſion of the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:207638:87"/>Backbone; Nephritic, Arthritic and Gouty Pains; Or in General any Acid humor irritating the Nerves whether in the Abdomen or Brain; But eſpecially in the Abdomen, for the Nerves of the <hi>Par Vagum,</hi> and thoſe of the Inter-Coſtal Branch furniſh both the Belly, Breaſt, and Neck with Nerves; and upon this Account we frequently obſerve that theſe Convulſive Aſthma's are attended by diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly Smptoms in the lower Belly. Beſides, if we conſider the Variety and Multitude of the Muſcles imploy'd in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, and the various Motions and Contrary Offices they are obliged to perform, we ſhall not be at a loſs to Imagin what a ſenſible Influence any ſort of Convulſions may have upon Breathing. This Convulſive ſort of Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's may likewiſe be caus'd by the Dryneſs and Flaccidity of the Lungs, following the Depravation of their Nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Juice; ſmoaking of Tobacco, Mineral ſteams frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly irritating the Fibres of the Lungs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The like may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue upon the ſtriking in of a Scab, or the unſeaſonable heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an Ulcer, the Blood being thereby render'd ſharp and irritating, and its Texture prone to irregular fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                        <p>An Aſthma is of its ſelf manifeſt. But the Symptoms ought to be heedfully regarded, in order to diſtinguiſh the various Cauſes. Thoſe which proceed from a Vicious form of the Breaſt, or from ſerum, or ſlime covering the Lungs, or from the Depravation of their own Nutritive Juice, are continual; Whereas the other ſorts are Periodical. All Aſthma's agree in this Symptom, that they are Exaſperat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Night, and when the Patient moves the Body, or Changes the Air. Moiſt Aſthma's are attended by a Cough, ſnoring and comfortable Expectoration of matter in and after the Paroxyſm. If the ſnoring make a deep hollow ſound, the matter lodges in the Bronchia. If it lodge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſubſtance of the Lungs the ſound is flatter, and the matter is not ſo Copiouſly brought up.</p>
                        <p>Dry Aſthma's come ſuddenly and diſappear in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner without any viſible cauſe, or diſcovery of Noxious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; They are not attended by Snoring, Coughing, or Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, unleſs it be towards the end of the Fit, and even then very ſparingly; For the matter thus expectorated is not the cauſe of the Diſeaſe as in the moiſt kind, but only ſqueez'd out by the Perplexity of the Muſcles, and Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lungs: Neither are they ſo greedy of Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as of Exſpiration, which is contrary to the method of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:207638:87"/>moiſt Aſthma's. If the cauſe of the Convulſive kind come Originally from the Head, the fit is uſher'd in by Head-aches and Swimming of the Head; If from the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by a murmuring Noiſe in the Guts; If the Midriff be chiefly affected, Pain Girds that Part where 'tis joyn'd to the ſhort Ribs; If the Muſcles of the Breaſt, the whole Breaſt ſeems to be ſqueez'd; If thoſe of the Throat and Wind Pipe, they are as it were ſtrangled; If the Lungs themſelves, They can give no other account, but that they cannot Breathe.</p>
                        <p>An Aſthma in malignant Caſes, or Acute Feavers is a fatal Symptom. The Convulſive ſort is more common than the moiſt; and of the moiſt ones, that from the Stomac is more frequently met with. If an Aſthma be Inveterat it ſeldom admits of a Radical Cure; and is oft-times follow'd by Cachexies, Swellings of the Feet, Dropſies, and then Death it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>If an Aſthma be only a Symptom of other Diſeaſes it yields to their Cure. If it be of the moiſt kind, the viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous matter ought to be attenuated and carried off, and the Stomac or Lungs fortify'd. The Convulſive kind is cur'd by appeaſing the Spirits, ſtrengthening the Nerves, and Diverting their Cauſe by Bliſtering Plaiſters and Iſſues. In order to obtain theſe ends, the following Cautions will aſſiſt us.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In the moiſt Aſthma's there's no Medicine equals a Vomit. It equally clears both the Stomac and Lungs, and may be given in the very height of the Fit, without the leaſt fear of ſtiffling. In a dry Aſthma proceeding from the lower Belly, it may be exhited after the Paroxyſm. Antimonial Preparations, or the Water or Syrup of Tobacco, or the Juice of the flower de luce, are proper on this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Some exhibit the Infuſion of white Hellebor in Rheniſh Wine. Some mix Emetic Ingredients with attenuating Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, but in ſo ſmall Doſes, that they only Expectorat; others premiſe attenuating Medicines by themſelves, and then exhibit a Vomit.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Cauſe a Vein to be ſpeedily open'd in any Aſthma whatſoever; and exhibit convenient Medicines for diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Congeal'd Blood, Correcting its Cachexy, and curbing its Turgeſcence.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. During the Fit, let all manner of Purgatives be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. After the Fit is over, they are uſeful, but ought always to be mix'd with Gum Ammoniac. As,</p>
                        <pb n="156" facs="tcp:207638:88"/>
                        <p>Take of the Pills of Ammoniac, fifteen Grains; Sweet Mercury, a ſcruple; Extract of Troches Alhandal, two Grains; Diſtill'd Oyl of Anis two drops. Make Pills. Some uſe <hi>Quercetanus</hi>'s Oxymel of Tobacco. Others the Decoctions of Aromatic Herbs and Senna, which evacuat Gradually.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. If the Diſeaſe proceed from ſerum, it ought to be carried off by Sweat, Urine, Bliſtering Plaiſters and Iſſues. Sudorifics, eſpecially of the Decoction of Guajacum and Saſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafras, are always uſeful in dry Convulſive Aſthma's. They expectorat alſo and attenuat, and therefore are not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the moiſt ſort. If the Stomac be faulty, the Acid Crudity muſt be Corrected and Expell'd.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Narcotics are of Sovereign uſe both in and before the Paroxyſm of a dry Aſthma. In the moiſt kind, If the Symptoms are very fierce, they are not improper.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. If it proceed from a Particular cauſe, it requires a Particular Cure. As if it be caus'd by the retreat of a Scab or Itch, let volatil ſudorifics, ſuch as the Decoctions of Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitory, Elecampane, Fennel, Extract of Venice Treacle, and the fixed Salts, be uſed for recalling the Itch; and if nothing prove effectual put the Patient to Bed with thoſe that are Scabby. If it proceed from Metallin Fumes, as Mercury, let Solar-Bezoar and Diaphoretic Antimony be exhibited. If from ſudden Cold or Drinking of Cold Water, exhibit the Juice of Daſies in Wine.</p>
                        <p>The ſpecifics commonly us'd for moiſt Aſthma's, or ſuch as flow from a viſcid matter whether in the Lungs or Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac, are the Roots of Cuckowpint, Hyſſop, Horehound, Roſemary and its Flowers, Saffron, Speedwell, Zedoary, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially its Spirit, the Juice of Briony, Elecampane Roots; The Syrup or Volatil Salt of Tobacco for old Perſons, Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Saffron, Eſſence of Saſſafras; the Juice of Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes; Oxymel of Squills mix'd with Cinnamon Water; Gum Ammoniac (above all) diſſolv'd in Vinegar; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Spirit of Verdigriſe mix'd with the thicken'd Juice of Coltsfoot; Dulcify'd Spirit of Nitre; Elixyr Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis; Sulphur, or its Spirit <hi>per Campanam;</hi> The Water of Turneps; <hi>Sperma Caeti;</hi> Turpentin diſſolv'd with the yelk of an Egg in a Convenient Vehicle; Balſam of Sulphur, Prepar'd with Oyl of Anis; Juice of Woodlice with Wine (an incomparable Medicine) and the Carminative Spirit, if the Stomac be diſorder'd. A Mercurial Salivation, or waſhes for the feet, in ſome Caſes are very effectual.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>THE Hickets are a Convulſive motion of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragm, bending it downward, diſtending the Belly, and provoking it to accelerat and interrupt Inſpiration. The Ancients refer'd it to the Stomac, but its influence over the Belly, its neceſſary dependence upon Inſpiration, its ready Obedience to the Command of our Will, its being cur'd by continu'd Inſpiration, Sneeſing, Mirth, and Violent Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, argue that 'tis Seated in the Middriff. 'Tis true, the Irritating Cauſe is frequently lodg'd in the upper Orifice of the Stomac, from whence it has a ſhort influence upon the Middriff, thro' which the Orifice Paſſes. Thus ſharp, acid, Cold Liquors and Victuals, or an acid Viſcous Phlegm in the Stomac, ſuch as Children are Obnoxious to, are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Authors of this Diſeaſe: As alſo the Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive motions of any other Membran that Correſponds with the Middriff, Violent Purgatives, Disjoynting of the Ribs, Inflammations of the Liver, Ruptures, and whatever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures the Guts, or Adjacent Membrans.

                        <p>The Cure conſiſts in abating the Convulſive ſenſe of the Middriff, and removing the material cauſe. The former end is compaſs'd by Narcotics mix'd with Specifics. Now the Specifics are Cinnamon, Maſtic; Galangal, Ginger, Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed, Burnt Hartſhorn, or Ivory, Spirit of Sal-armoniac and eſpecially Caſtor.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>THE Night-Mare is either Accidental or Habitual. The former is occaſion'd by the Diſtention of the Stomac with Wind or Crudities, and prevails when Perſons are aſleep and lye upon their Backs. For then the Stomac dilated preſſes the Middriff and Muſcles of the Bread moſt; and ſo incumbers the deſcent of the one and dilatation of the other, which are neceſſary for Inſpiration. Thus the Blood ſtagnats in the Lungs, and the Perſon is not able to ſpeak, or breathe freely, but fancies himſelf preſs'd by ſome particular Object. The <hi>Habitual</hi> is occaſion'd by ſome Acid Lymph that diſorders the Spirits and Creates a Paralytic or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive Diſpoſition of the Nerves of the Middriff and Muſcles of the Breaſt; which by conſent Cramp thoſe of the Wind Pipe, whoſe Contraction raiſes a ſenſe of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling, and aboliſhes the Power of an Articulat Voice. Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondiac and Scorbutic Perſons are moſt ſubject to this habitual ſort, which is frequently attended by red ſpots in the skin, and ſeems to be near a-kin to an Epilepſy. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times 'tis the effect of Worms, and equally attacks the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient both by Night and by Day.</p>
                        <p>The Symptoms are a Difficult Reſpiration (for the moſt part in the time of ſleep) an imagination of ſomething hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy preſſing the Breaſt, a querulous inarticulat Noiſe, an ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to move; and after the Perſon is awake and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm over, a wearineſs of the Limbs, Anxiety of the Breaſt and Palpitation of the Heart. If it be Habitual and come by day, and be follow'd by a Trembling, Swooning and Cold ſweats, 'tis very dangerous, and Prognoſticats Convulſions to young Perſons, and Apoplexies to the Old.</p>
                        <p>The cure conſiſts in Evacuating the Stomac, regulating the Diet, avoiding ſleep ſoon after eating; and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating Convulſions. Firſt let Vomits be exhibited; Or if that cannot conveniently be done, Purge with the Extract of black Hellebor, ſweet Mercury, and Extract of Troches Alhandal mix'd with Oyl of Amber; or with the Pills call'd Aloephanginae, and <hi>Elixyr Proprietatis.</hi> If Wind diſturb the firſt Paſſages, inject a Carminative Clyſter.

The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Cauſes of Sneezing are Various according to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibleneſs of the Membran, for ſome who by the frequent uſe of ſnuſh, have procur'd a plentiful deſcent of Rheum into the Noſtrils, are not ſo eaſily mov'd.

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:207638:91"/>proceeds chiefly from the Noſtrils and Palate, and adjacent Glandules, and ſecondarily from the Breaſt, Wind Pipe and Lungs; If ſneezing be violent and frequent it diſcovers great diſorder among the Spirits.

                        <p>THE <hi>Voice</hi> is the ſound of the Air expell'd by the Wind Pipe, and conſequently differs from Speech which is form'd by the Tongue. The firſt diſorder 'tis Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to is that of a Total Abolition, which may ariſe from three ſources. 1. When the Muſcles of the Wind Pipe are Paralytic, and do not ſqueeſe out the Air; as if a redundancy of moiſture over-charge 'em, or if the Recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Nerves are Cut, or if an Apoplectic diſorder ſieze the Spirits. 2. When the Muſcles and Nerves of the Wind Pipe are Contracted by Convulſions, ſo that they hinder the Paſſage of the Air. Thus the ſmall Pox, a recent Clap, and Worms have been obſerv'd for its Authors. 3. When the Spirits are ſuddenly diſorder'd by Fear, or Violent Paſſion.</p>
                        <p>If a want of Voice Accompany an Apoplexy, or malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Feavers, or the Hickets, 'tis an ill Omen. If follow'd by a Looſeneſs (to which ſtammering Perſons are Obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) it generally diſappears.</p>
                        <p>For Cure; The Irritation muſt be appeas'd; The Palſy remov'd; Or the prevailing humidity diſpell'd. For which end the Spirit of Sal-armoniac Diſtill'd with Oyl of Amber and Eſſence of Caſtor, the Spirit of Wine impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with Lavender Flowers, the Sudorific Decoctions of Woods, and Chewing Medicines are proper; as alſo Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſome Caſes. Externally, we apply Bags of Aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Ingredients ſprinkled with Spirit of Wine, or that of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:207638:91"/>Ants; Venice Treacle, or Balſam of Peru mix'd with the Eſſence of Caſtor and the Oyls (by Decoction) of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Lavender, Spike, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or the mouth may be Gargled as follows.</p>
                        <p>Take of Sage and Roſemary Leaves, of each a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; Rocket and Muſtard ſeeds, of each a dram; Boyl them in a Cloſe Veſſel. To a Pound of the ſtrain'd De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, add of the Spirit of Black Cherries, and Spirit of Sal-armoniac, of each a dram; Hony of Roſemary Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, a dram. Mix for a Gargariſm.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond diſorder of the Voice is a <hi>Hoarſeneſs;</hi> occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd by a prevailing moiſture in the Wind Pipe, ſeparated by the Glandules inſerted into it, and the Glandulous Membran that lines it within. A Recent Hoarſeneſs ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes a thin humor; but the Inveterat argues it thick and ſlimy. The Remote Cauſes are either External or Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. The former are acid Fumes, ſharp Liquors, much ſpeaking, or whatever Irritats the Wind Pipe and Promotes the Conſtriction of its Glandules. The latter are the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of a ſharp tickling ſerum in its Glandules, as in the Scurvy, <hi>French</hi> Pox, and a Cough; the ſtuffing of the Noſe, and the Indiſpoſition of the Lungs. If a Hoarſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be Inveterat, and Spring from Internal Cauſes, 'tis very dangerous.</p>
                        <p>The Cure is vary'd according to the Conſiſtence of the Peccant Lymph. If it be thin and ſharp it diſcovers it ſelf by its manner of tickling, and the thinneſs of what is caſt up: And requires tempering, thickening, Pacific Medicines; (Purgatives being firſt premis'd if there be occaſion.) Such are the Syrup of Poppies, or Diacodium, Liquorice, the Juice of Rapes, Raiſins, <hi>Sperma Ceti</hi> given to a dram in a warm Vehicle, the mucilage of Marſhmallow Roots, the Oyl of Sugar, the Balſam and Flowers of Sulphur, Myrrh, and eſpecially the Syrup of Jujubes. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Syrup of white Poppies, ſix drams; Syrups of Violets, Liquorice and Jujubes, of each half an ounce: Rob of Mulberries, three drams. Make a licking mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Juice of Liquorice, two drams; Myrrh, a dram; Tragacanth a Scruple; Clarify'd Sugar, two ounces. With Roſe Water; Make Tablets to be gradually melted in the mouth.</p>
                        <p>If the Hoarſeneſs be Inveterat, and the Eymph become Thick and Cruſty, Bleeding is Pernicious; but Attenuating
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:207638:92"/>Ingredients are proper. Such are Hedg-muſtard, or its ſeed form'd into an Electuary with the Pulp of Corants; The Balſam of Sulphur with the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Cuckowpint Roots, the Spirit of Sal-armoniac, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bebs, the thicken'd Juice of Coleworts; Oxymel of Squills; and an Electuary made of Hony, Elecampane Roots, Sage, and Water Germander-leaves. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of Scabious Water, three ounces; the Aſthmatical Water, ſix drams; Spirit of Sal-armoniac Aniſated, a dram and a half; Syrup of Hyſſop, and Syrup of Hedg Muſtard, of each ſix drams. Mix for a Potion.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Clarify'd Juice of Coleworts, two ounces; Powder of Cuckowpint Roots, a dram; With Oxymel of Squills, make an Electuary.</p>

                        <head>ART. III. <hi>Of a Cough.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>A Cough is a frequent and interrupted Exſpiration, or Convulſion of the Middriff and Muſcles of the Breaſt, attended by a Conſtriction of the Wind Pipe, without which 'twould make no Noiſe. The Immediat cauſe is the Irritation and Provocation of the Wind Pipe, or Lungs; or of the Muſcles Dedicated for Reſpiration. This may proceed either from an irritating matter Seated directly in theſe places: Or from a foreign Cauſe conveying its Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by the Commerce of the Nerves, and creating a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive dry Cough, ſuch as Hypochondriac and Hyſteric Perſons, or thoſe in whoſe Bodies an Acid prevails, are very liable to. But we ſhall confine our thoughts to that which proceeds from the immediat Influence of ſome material cauſe. And in order to form a diſtinct Idaea of it, ſhall conſider both its External and Internal Cauſes, ſuppoſing ſtill that the diſtinction of a dry and wet Cough is minded and underſtood.</p>
                        <p>The External Cauſes are acid mineral fumes, ſharp li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, hard Food and an Intemperat Air. The acid fumes and ſharp particles of Air tickle the Wind Pipe, and Pitui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Membran that lines the Palat, and by influencing the Nerves of the Muſcles of the Breaſt (which ſpring from the ſame branch of the Intercoſtal Nerve, as thoſe of the Wind Pipe) occaſion the Contraction of the Breaſt and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:207638:92"/>pulſion of what it contains. In like manner ſharp liquors or grating Food, by tickling that part of the Gullet which immediatly joyns the Wind Pipe, produce the ſame effect. Now this Irritation at the firſt occaſions a dry Cough, and ſqueezes only a thin ſerum from the Contracted Glandules. But if it continue long the parts are inflam'd or corroded, and their Nouriſhment degenerats into a ſlimy, thick mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which Chriſteus it a wet Cough. The Ancients ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd that this matter either Diſtill'd from the Head, or was depoſited in the Lungs by the Blood; but they were miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, ſince this vicious matter is rather the effect than the cauſe of a Cough.</p>
                        <p>The Internal cauſes relating to a wet Cough, are ſeated either in the Wind Pipe and Lungs, or in the Gullet and Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac. Thoſe in the Wind Pipe and Lungs are the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſerum depoſited by the Blood, Ulcers, Impoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humes, Inflammations, Morbifical matter transfer'd thither in the Declenſion of Acute Diſeaſes, Stagnation of Blood in the Lungs, and the ſuppuration of a Pleuriſy, <hi>Empyema,</hi> or <hi>Peripueumonia.</hi> Now all theſe cauſes occaſion the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Irritating humors, and convert the Nutritious Juice of the parts into a thick, ſordid, purulent matter; Nay, ſometimes carry the Curruption ſo high that pieces of the very Lungs and Veins, Worms, Stones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are caſt up.</p>
                        <p>The Internal cauſes of a wet Cough relating to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac, are a defluxion of a viſcid Lymph from the hinder <hi>Membrana Pituitaria</hi> into the Stomac, or Indigeſted Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities collected about its upper Orifice; but eſpecially the firſt. This Lymph falling from the Membran into the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac, gave occaſion to the Error of the Ancients in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Catarrhs to the Head. When it irritates the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac, eſpecially thoſe parts which joyn the Wind Pipe and Middriff, it occaſions their Conſtriction which ſeldom ceaſes till ſome part of the offending matter be caſt up. Theſe Coughs proceeding from the Stomac, are more frequent than thoſe from the Breaſt; from whence we may diſcover the miſtake of thoſe who fancy'd that the matter caſt up by Coughing came always from the Lungs.</p>
                        <p>The Internal cauſe of a dry Cough, is the ſharpneſs of the Lymph watring the Throat, and ſeparated by its Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules for that purpoſe; occaſion'd by a weak Digeſtion, or Crudity of the Chyle in the Maſs of Blood. Sometimes a thin ſalin humor provoking the upper Orifice of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:207638:93"/>doth likewiſe cauſe a vehement dry Cough, as the Chin Cough of Children. But if the humor or Lymph be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thick, it degenerats into a wet one. In the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſms of Intermitting Feavers, we frequently meet with dry Coughs that proceed from a vicious fermentation of the humors in the <hi>Duodenum,</hi> irritating the Stomac, and conſequently the Middriff and Wind Pipe. Preternatural Excreſcences in the Lungs and Organs of Reſpiration, may be alſo liſted among the cauſes of dry Coughs.</p>
                        <p>As for the Diagnoſtics of Coughs. A wet Cough is known by the viſcous matter it brings up; as a dry one by its ſmall quantity of thin ſerum. As for wet Coughs, a ſuperficial ſound, eaſy Reſpiration, and the high ſeat of the Pain, diſcover their Original from the Wind Pipe; as a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult Reſpiration, or an aptneſs to Cough upon a large In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, a hollow hoarſe ſound follow'd immediatly by evacuation, night Feavers and Phthiſical Symptoms, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer 'em to the Lungs: But a pain and weight under the pit of the Breaſt, attended ſometimes by a difficult Reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Vomiting of Phlegm, a deep hollow ſound with a tearing fierce Cough, and Proſtration of the Appetit, aſcribe 'em to the Stomac. A dry Cough proceeding from ſharp ſaltiſh Lymph relents in the Day time, and towards evening reaſſumes its former force, with a gentle ſhivering, follow'd by a Violent Heat, and Night Feavers. Such are thoſe that uſher in the ſmall Pox, or Phthiſics, or follow the retreat of Curicular Eruptions in Children. Their Nocturnal Exacerbations are common to all Lymphatic Diſeaſes, and are in ſome meaſure caus'd by the want of equal tranſpiration with that of the Day. But theſe dry Coughs always become wet by continuance. The Coughs that Old and Arthritic Perſons are ſubject to, ſeem to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a weak Digeſtion in the Stomac, where the crude viſcid matter aſſembles and provokes the adjacent Wind Pipe and Middriff. Sometimes Pectoral and Stoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical, Moiſt and Convulſive Coughs are mutually Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated.</p>
                        <p>Violent Inveterat Coughs threaten Ruptures, or Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying; and promote infirmities of the Head and Eyes. A ſtomachical Cough continuing long, viriats the Lymph and Produces a Phthific, as alſo the Nocturnal dry Coughs. To Scorbutical or Hydropical Perſons, any Cough is an ill Omen.</p>
                        <pb n="167" facs="tcp:207638:93"/>
                        <p>The cure conſiſts in allaying the Irritation, and remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the offenſive cauſe; for which ends Opiats, Vomits, Thickening, Attenuating and Vulnerary Med'cines are in uſe. However, for obtaining a diſtinct method of cure, let the following directions be minded.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Opium</hi> is not convenient in wet Coughs (<hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe attended by a viſcid matter) till the Univerſal Evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are premis'd. A dry cough caus'd by External Air, or Mineral ſteams, is admirably cur'd by <hi>Laudanum Opiatum</hi> in the Beginning. To which we add <hi>Sylvius</hi>'s Pills of Storax; The Decoction of Zedoary in Wine; The Decoction of Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins and Elecampane Roots in Wine; Or of Juniper berries in Ale; taken in order to ſweat. For Preſervatives againſt the Influence of the Air, we may anoint the Noſtrils with the Diſtill'd Oyls of Anis, Amber and Mace; and ſnuff up the Powder of black Hellebor mix'd with Sugar and Oyl of Cloves.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If an accidental dry Cough by continuance become moiſt, and void ſlimy matter, let a Vomit be firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, and then Opiats, follow'd by Pectoral Vulnerary Preſcriptions if the matter be lodg'd in the Breaſt, and Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machical Arematics if it lye in the Stomac. The Pecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ingredients are Ground-Ivy, Chervil, Speedwell, Scabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Elecampane Roots, Coltsfoot, and Saſſafras. The Stomachical are, Mint, Zedoary, <hi>Elixyr Proprietatis,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. A wet Pectoral Cough is formally cur'd by Attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating and Expectorating Ingredients interlac'd with Vomits, or moderat Purges; and follow'd by Vulnerary Medicines for healing the corroded parts.</p>
                        <p>The Attenuating Ingredients are Cuckowpint Roots, the freſh Juice of Radiſhes given with Sugar, the Decoction of Horehound or of Elecampane, Gum Ammoniac, Ground Ivy, Hyſſop, Ginger, Syrup of Tobacco, Oxymel of Squills, Hedg Muſtard, Spirit of Sal-armoniac, Aniſeeds, and the Carminative Spirit <hi>de tribus</hi> given to forty drops thrice a day.</p>
                        <p>Take of Hyſſop Water, two ounces; Speedwell Water, an ounce; Aſthmatical Water, half an ounce; Spirit of Sal-armoniac, a dram; Syrup of Tobacco, an ounce. Mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Vulnerary Ingredients are the flowers of Sulphur, the Balſam of Sulphur Aniſated given to fifteen drops in the yelk of an Egg twice a day, Benzoin, Poterius's Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hectic, Diaphoretic Antimony, and the Vulnerary Plants.</p>
                        <pb n="168" facs="tcp:207638:94"/>
                        <p>Take of Crabs Eyes, and Flowers of Sulphur, of each a Scruple; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> a Grain; Diſtill'd Oyl of Anis, a drop; make a Powder.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Herbs Speedwell, Ground Ivy and Scabious, of each a handful; Chervil, a handful and a half; Shav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Saſſafras, an ounce. Boyl them in Water, adding at laſt Bruis'd Corants, two ounces; Liquorice Roots, an ounce; And after 'tis taken off the fire, three drams of Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon hung in a Bag.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. A wet Stomachical Cough proceeding from a viſcid matter in the Stomac is cur'd by exhibiting firſt Vomits, then Purges mix'd with attenuating Ingredients; As,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Pills of Hiera with Agaric, fifteen Grains; Gum Ammoniac diſſolv'd in Vinegar, half a ſcruple; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of Troches Alhandal, two Grains; Diſtill'd Oyl of Anis, two drops. With Eſſence of Gum Ammoniac, make Pills. Sweet Mercury may alſo be added.</p>
                        <p>After Purgation it will be requiſite to prepare the matter for Expectoration by attenuating Compoſitions; and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end, when the viſcid matter is in good meaſure evacuated, we may add the Syrup of Poppies, As,</p>
                        <p>Take of Ouckowpint Roots, a dram and a half; Gum Ammoniac diſſolv'd in Vinegar, Maſtic, of each a Scruple; Tartar Vitriolated, half a dram. With Sugar diſſolv'd in Mint Water, make Tablets.</p>
                        <p>Take of Hyſſop and Mint Water, of each an ounce; Aſthmatical Water, ſix drams; Cinnamon and Oxymel of Squills, of each an ounce; Gum Ammoniac diſſolv'd in Vinegar of Squills, two drams; Dulcify'd Spirit of Salt, as much as ſufficieth. Mix. Doſe a ſpoonful now and then.</p>
                        <p>After the uſe of attenuating Medicines, 'twill be proper to ſtrengthen the Stomac by <hi>Elixyr Proprietatis,</hi> Eſſence of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecampane, Decoction of Zedoary, Spirit of Sal-armoniac, Eſſence of Saffron; and Chocolat which is uſeful againſt all Coughs; As Sage and Water Germander Leaves, Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Sulphur, and <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> mix'd with the Syrup <hi>Diacodium</hi> in the form of an Electuary, are very convenient againſt all wet Coughs.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Dry Nocturnal Coughs proceeding from the acidity and ſaltneſs of the Lymph, are cur'd by Volatil Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorifics mix'd with Opiats, a Vomit being premis'd if it be needful. The Volatil ſudorifies are the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Sal-armoniac, or the Spirit of Hartſhorn ſuccinated,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:207638:94"/>mix'd with the Eſſence of <hi>Opium,</hi> Amber, Myrrh, Sylvius's Pills of Storax; to which we may ſubjoyn the Incraſſating Pectorals, ſuch as the Flowers of Sulphur given to a ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in a Potch'd Egg, Benzoin, <hi>Sperma Ceti;</hi> the Diſtill'd Oyl of Anis and Fennel, the Syrup of Jujubes, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Rapes (a very ſucceſsful Medicine) the Juice of Liquorice Purg'd from its Adulterating Ingredients by a Diſſolution in Hyſſop Water, Gum Arabic, Marſhmallow Roots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For Example.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Spirit of Sal-armoniac Succinated, Tincture of Sulphur, of each a dram; Eſſence of <hi>Opium,</hi> half a dram. Mix. Doſe forty drops, to be taken two hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Supper.</p>
                        <p>Take of prepar'd Amber, half a ſcruple; choice Myrrh, and Volatil ſalt of Amber, of each five Grains; Extract of Saffron, two or four Grains; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> one or two Grains; With the Eſſence of Saſſafras make Pills, to be taken two hours before Supper.</p>

                        <p>Take of the Roots of <hi>Florentin Orris,</hi> two drams; Flowers of ſulphur, a dram; Diſtill'd Oyl of Anis, half a dram; Diſtill'd Oyl of Fennel, fifteen drops; White Sugar, three drams. Make a Powder, of which exhibit a dram twice a day.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Extract of ſulphur Pulveris'd, twelve Grains; Extract of Saffron, two Grains; Choice Myrrh, four Grains; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> a Grain; With the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Amber, Make Pills.</p>

With the Syrup of white Poppies, Make Pills. This is the Compoſition of <hi>Sylvius</hi>'s Pills of Storax which are of Excellent uſe in Nocturnal Coughs. The Juice of Liquorice is frequently adulterated, and do's more harm then good; To prevent this Inconvenience, 'twill be requiſit to preſcribe always the Juice of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Liquorice, or at leaſt to diſſolve the ordinary Juice of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quorice in Hyſſop Water, and Strain it before it be thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd; that ſo the impure dregs may be ſeparated.</p>

If a dry Noctural Cough continue ſo long that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to void Corrupt matter, and that the Lungs are Ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, let a draught of the Decoction of Guajacum and Saſſafras, or of China and Raiſins, be exhibited every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and Opiats at Night. And apply an Ointment of Hogs Tallow and Onyon Heads to the Feet in the Evening, for three days together.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. The dry Chin Cough ariſing from the Stomac, is cur'd thus. Firſt give a Vomit, then exhibit twice a day a ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

                        <head>ART. IV. <hi>Of a Choaking Catarrh.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THAT which the Ancients call'd a Choaking Catarrh, is a Diſeaſe cauſing difficult Reſpiration, and Threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening Suffocation; which ſeems to be Complicated of an Aſthma, Cough, and Hoarſeneſs. The Ancients fancy'd that a Catarrh falls from the Head, and overflows the Lungs; But Anatomy affords no Paſſage for ſuch a deſcent, and therefore we ſhall wave their Opinions. For the moſt part Convulſive Aſthma's are miſcall'd Catarrhs; or whatever ſymptom of this Nature is different from them, may be caſt into theſe four Heads.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. A fear of ſuffocation may inſue when the Lungs are ſtuff'd and provok'd to Contract their fibres by a viſcid He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneous Acid; as if ſulphureous fumes ſhould ſtick to 'em like foot to a Chimney, they'd provoke the Lungs to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:207638:96"/>contract and ſqueeſe out Lymph, with which they joyn in the form of a new Concrete, till being concocted together they find a vent by Expectoration. Upon which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction and Difficulty of Breathing ceaſes; But the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritious Juice of the Lungs is ſo deprav'd that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Propenſity to relapſe upon the leaſt occaſion. The acid that prevails in Children renders them alſo liable to this ſymptom. 'Tis cur'd by Opiats and Thickening Medicines.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. When the Head of the Wind Pipe and Epiglottis are provok'd to Contraction, as when a bit of Bread falling into it cauſes a Coughing, Hoarſeneſs, difficult breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and voiding of matter. The cauſe in reſpect of the Larynx, is either External or Internal. The former is a viſcous thick Lymph falling from the hinder <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brana Pituitaria</hi> into the Wind Pipe, eſpecially in the Night time and when the Patient lies on his back, which Irritats and Tickles the Head of the Wind Pipe, provokes the Epiglottis to ſhut and hinder Reſpiration, occaſions a hoarſeneſs, ſnoring and ſpitting of thin mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which in proceſs of time becomes thick and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted. The latter is a ſharp Lymph, lodg'd within the Wind Pipe and producing the like effects.</p>
                        <p>As for cure, if it proceed from the cauſe that is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal or Foreign to the Wind Pipe, it requires a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and Attenuating Medicines, <hi>viz.</hi> The Juice of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhes, Syrup of Tobacco, Gum Ammoniac, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in a word, the ſame cure with the Inveterat moiſt Gough. As for Example.</p>
                        <p>Take of Hyſſop Water, Mint Water, and the Water of Tobacco, of each an ounce; The Aſthmatical Water, ſix drams; Oxymel of Squills, half an ounce; Syrup of Tobacco ſix drams, or an ounce. Mix and make a Potion, of which give a ſpoonful now and then: Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of Hyſſop Water and Scabious Water, of each an ounce and a half; The Aſthmatical Water, ſix drams; Gum Ammoniac diſſolv'd in Vinegar, a dram; Syrup of Scabious, an ounce; Mix and Exhibit as above.</p>
                        <p>To theſe and ſuch like mixtures, we may add opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ats now and then. The Water of Hedge Muſtard with Gum Ammoniac diſſolv'd in Vinegar, the Roots of Cuckowpint, and <hi>Michael</hi>'s Aſthmatical Spirit Prepared from Verdigris and Gum Ammoniac, are alſo very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
                        <pb n="173" facs="tcp:207638:96"/>
                        <p>If this Symptom proceeds from an Internal cauſe, 'tis cur'd by ſudorifics mix'd with Opiats, Vomits being premis'd if there be occaſion; after the ſame manner as a dry Nocturnal Cough proceeding from a ſharp Lymph.</p>
                        <p>Take of Mint Water, Scabious Water, Water of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Thyme, of each an ounce; Aſthmatical Water, ſix drams; Spirit of Sal-armoniac Aniſated, two drams; Flowers of ſulphur, half a dram; Syrup of Diacodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, an ounce. Mix and give a ſpoonful now and then. Or.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Eſſence againſt Catarrhs, three drams, the Spirit of Sal-armoniac Aniſated, a dram. Mix and Exhibit a Convenient quantity frequently.</p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Aqua Articularis ad Extra,</hi> two drams; Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of black Cherries, and of Lilly of the Vally, of each a dram; Eſſence of <hi>Opium,</hi> two ſcruples. Mix and apply it with a warm Cloth to the Region of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynx,</hi> eſpecially when the Perſon is ſenſible of a tickling, or conſtriction in that part.</p>
                        <p>If this Diſeaſe return frequently let an Iſſue be cut in the Arm. Clyſters, Blood-letting, Bliſtering Plaiſters, and all the Stratagems of the Ancients Calculated for Defluxions from the Head are of no uſe.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The third ſort of Suffocation, or <hi>Catarrhus Suffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cativus,</hi> happens when the Blood ſtagnats in the Lungs. In this Caſe it is coincident with a <hi>Syncope Cardiaca,</hi> approaches to a <hi>Peripneumonia,</hi> and is attended by the Symptoms of an Apoplexy. Nay, Apoplectic Perſons, when Dead, have their Lungs ſtuff'd after the ſame manner as thoſe who dye of this diſtemper; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Hypocrates Styl'd it a ſtrangling <hi>Aph.</hi> 13. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. The froth that ſometimes attends this Paroxyſm, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Impriſon'd Blood in the Lungs, when Rarify'd by Air: Thus, if we inject Oyl of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentin into a Dogs Veins, it congeals the Blood in the Lungs, and cauſes a plentiful evacuation of froth. The ſlime that is alſo voided, proceeds from the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules of the Wind Pipe, which are provok'd to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Contractions by the Anxiety of the Breaſt; and ſo ſeparate large quantities of ſerum, which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the Air in Exſpiration. Beſides, the Pituitous Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bran being ſtraiten'd by this Anxiety Diſtills a viſcous Lymph upon the Wind Pipe, which helps to make up the quantity.</p>
                        <pb n="174" facs="tcp:207638:97"/>
                        <p>The remote cauſes of this ſtagnation (which the Ancients erroneouſly miſcall'd a Catarrh) are. 1. The redundancy or over-bearing Turgeſcence of Blood. 2. The Viſcidity of the Blood occaſion'd by Crude Chyle. 3. Its Coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion caus'd by cold Air, by an inconſiderat aſſumption of cold Water immediatly after great heats; by fear, or by the Influence of a Vicious Acid. 4. The accidental obſtruction of the Lungs, by Stones, Excreſcences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ſymptoms are a ſenſe of weight upon the Breaſt, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of breathing, danger of Choaking, a very ſlow pulſe, and ſometimes a Cough, and a fatal evacuation of froth and ſlime. 'Tis diſtinguiſh'd from an Apoplexy, by the difficulty of Reſpiration, and lowneſs of the Pulſe.</p>
                        <p>For Cure; Blood-letting is abſolutely neceſſary; and ought to be perform'd betimes; after which a ſharp Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter may be injected; and ſcarifying Cupping-Glaſſes appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſeveral parts of the Body. Then give <hi>Sperma Ceti</hi> to a dram in Hyſſop Water. Gum Ammoniac diſſolv'd in Vinegar, or its Spirit Prepar'd with Verdigris, Saffron, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil ſalt of Amber, Spirit of Hartſhorn, Crabs Eyes, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoretic Antimony, the Juice of the flowers of red Daſies, and the Vulnerary herbs, eſpecially the Juice of Radiſhes, are alſo very proper. As for the Ligatures, Frictions, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſms, Plaiſters, Gargariſms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> recommended by the Ancients, they are of no uſe; as being only contriv'd in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of their miſtake, aſſigning a Chimerical defluxion from the Head for the cauſe of this diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>Theſe three different ſorts of choaking Diſeaſes, miſcall'd Catarrhs, ought to be carefully diſtinguiſh'd; by reaſon that their Cures are ſo very different.</p>

                  <head>SECT. XV. <hi>Of the accidents that diſturb the transformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Chyle; and fermentation of the Blood.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE Chyle being ſeparated in the Guts, and convey'd thro' the milky veſſels into the Conduit of the Breaſt, joyns the Blood in the left Subclavian Vein; and by vertue of fermentation is wrought into the ſame colour, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence.</p>
                  <p>This Fermentation, which for the moſt part aſſimilates the <hi>Chyle,</hi> ſprings from the Vital Spirit, and ſaline principle lodg'd in the Blood; which is enliven'd and reinforc'd by the continu'd ſupplies of the air receiv'd in the Lungs. For the <hi>Chyle</hi> is carried up to the Subclavian Vein, in order to have a ſhorter paſſage into the Lungs, where the mixt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure of Blood and <hi>Chyle</hi> is diſſolv'd, and rarify'd; the acid and urinous Salts are diſengaged, and render'd volatil, which by juſtling and encountring each the other produce a notable Fermentation; by virtue of which the Sulphureous and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil parts joyn together, and are inveſted with a red Colour. Beſides, the <hi>Chyle</hi> is tinctur'd with the Sulphur of the <hi>Choler</hi> in the Guts, and ſo prediſpos'd to a likeneſs and eaſy union with the Blood.</p>
                  <p>This Transformation of the <hi>Chyle</hi> is not accompliſh'd by one ſingle paſſage thro' the Lungs, but muſt be compleated by repeated Circulations along with the Blood. Which truth is plainly made out by the <hi>Chyle</hi> or Milky liquor that ſwims upon Blood drawn forth, four or five hours after eating. So that the maſs of Blood conſiſts naturally of <hi>Chyle</hi> and Blood, which being perfectly mix'd make up an univocal Homogeneous Liquor. 'Tis true the Ancients ſpeak of four humours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as being different ingredients of the Blood, which they infer'd from the apparent unequal condition or the ſeveral parts of Blood drawn forth from the Body; but that is owing only to its Corruption, or alteration oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:207638:98"/>by the Nitrous Salts of the Air. Upon which account all ſpecial predictions, grounded on the external ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Blood, are frivolous and uncertain.</p>
                  <p>This regular Fermentation and Aſſimilation is diſordered by the defects of the <hi>Chyle,</hi> or the Blood. The former may be caſt into three heads. 1. When the <hi>Chyle</hi> is not ſufficiently digeſted, attenuated, and volatilis'd in the Stomach. 2. When it is not duely tinctur'd with the Oyly Sulphur of the <hi>Choler.</hi> 3. When the Choleric or pancreatic Juices are tardy in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating its dregs. The Latter into theſe. 1. When the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood is rais'd beyond its natural pitch. 2. When 'tis depreſs'd and diminiſh'd. 3. When its ſubſtance is adulterated. The ſigns by which we deſcry a diſorderly fermentation are the pulſe and urine. But they are oft-times fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious. For the pulſe may be immediately influenc'd by the Animal Spirits, without any dependance upon the fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood; and the Urine may be diſguis'd by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or the diſorders of the ſolid parts imploy'd in that ſervice.</p>
                  <p>The immediat cauſe of a diſorderly fermentation of the Blood, is the degeneracy of the Urinous and Acid Salts from their due proportion and harmony. The remote cauſes are; the various Contagious particles convey'd into the Body with the Air or any other vehicle; antecedent loſſes of Blood, diſorders of the Bowels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Cure is perform'd by Saline Remedies calculated for the particular indiſpoſition of the Blood, and vary'd accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the difference of Temperaments. Of which more above.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of Feavers in general.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>A Feaver is a vicious fermentation of the Blood, in which its temperament is deprav'd, and the whole Body diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd. The infinite variety of Feaveriſh ferments, occaſions a great many various depravations of the Blood. But in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, the formal Eſſence of all Feavers conſiſts in a preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural fermentation of the Blood, occaſion'd by a foreign ferment, which ſometimes immediately affects the Blood, ſometimes the Spirits, and ſometimes both; at which time Nature indeavours to throw out the heterogeneous particles. In order to make this appear, let us Conſider the following Remarks.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the eating of Summer Fruits frequently cauſes Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. Now theſe are indow'd with a notable propenſity to ferment. 2. That Cold, or what ever impairs the inſenſible tranſpiration, produces the like effect. Now the Vicious Salts thus impriſon'd and overflowing in the Blood, cannot affect it any other way, than by creating a fermentation. 3. That Feavers inſue the inſpiration of Contagious particles, which naturally propagate by fermenting. 4. That the Rotten Feavers mention'd by the ancients, are only explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the Doctrine of fermentations; for no living thing can be properly intitled to putrefaction, unleſs by it be meant a turbulent confus'd motion, proceeding from the diſſolution of contrary Salts; as that of Spirit of <hi>Vitriol</hi> and Oyl of <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Common Symptoms of Feavers are likewiſe vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for the fermentation that cauſes 'em. Theſe are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reckon'd four, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. An alteration of the pulſe. 2. A Chilneſs, ſhivering, and ſhaking 3. Exceſſive heat. 4. The Change of Urine, both as to the Liquor and what it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</p>
                     <p>As for the firſt. A preternatural frequency of the pulſe, from an internal cauſe, is accounted by <hi>Silvius</hi> a peculiar and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:207638:99"/>infallible Symptom of a Feaver (tho' ſome malignant Feavers ſeem to make an exception to the Rule.) For the moſt part the pulſe is alſo ſwifter. Now theſe effects are plainly reſolvable into the fermentation of the Blood, or the irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Heart and Spirits, occaſion'd by a foreign fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>As for the ſecond: A Chilneſs, ſhivering, and ſhaking differ only gradually. The firſt is only a light Convulſion of the Skin, and contraction of the pores, reſembling the ſenſe of Cold; tho, in the mean while the Body feels hot to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal touch. If the muſcles are likewiſe affected, it creates a ſhivering, and ſometimes a ſtiffneſs. Theſe effects proceed from a prevalent Acid which twitches the membranous parts, and corrupts the maſs of Blood. In the beginning of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting or Continual Feavers, theſe Convulſions chiefly affect the internal and noble parts. But after the height of Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or Favourable Feavers they are ſeated for the moſt part in the external Membrans, and portend Critical eruptions.</p>
                     <p>The third Symptom is the immoderat Heat of the Body. I call it only a Symptom; for 'tis not Eſſential to a Fever, as ſome would have it. For ſome diſeaſes are attended with a preternatural Heat, that are not accompany'd by a Feaver, and beſides, there are ſome Feavers that are not hot, but on the contrary notably Cold. Tho' this advance may ſound like a paradox, 'tis back'd by <hi>Hippocrates, Avicenna, Galen, Bartholin,</hi> and <hi>Helmont:</hi> Nay, I my ſelf have met with an inſtance of an intermitting Feaver, that had no hot fits at all; which I cur'd, after the common evacuations, by a mixture of Spirit of <hi>Sal-armoniac</hi> and Spirit of <hi>Scurvy-graſs,</hi> exhibited in the intermitting days, and a Powder of <hi>Tartar</hi> vitriolated, or Salt of <hi>Wormwood</hi> with prepar'd <hi>Crabs Eyes,</hi> taken ſome hours before the invaſion of the <hi>Paroxyſm.</hi> To return to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural heat which for the moſt part attends Feavers, 'tis ſometimes moiſt when the fibres of the Skin are unbended, and the ſteams of the humours copiouſly exhal'd. Sometimes when theſe fibres are contracted, 'tis dry. If the Acid Salts are not much exalted, 'tis meek and tolerable; but if theſe ſharper Salts abound in the Blood, the heat gives a biting and fiery impreſſion to the external Organs of touching.</p>
                     <p>This preternatural Heat ſprings immediatly from the boyling and ſtruggling of the Salts in the maſs of Blood. The Occaſional Cauſe is an Acid, which ſometimes infects chiefly the Spirits; and then the heat is remiſſer, than when it prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally affects the Blood. It deſtroys the eſtabliſh'd propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:207638:99"/>of the Salts, and ſo gives riſe to vicious: fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. To make good this aſſertion, namely, that an Acid is the principal author of exceſſive heat, and conſequently of Feavers themſelves; it will not be improper to mention the following Obſervations.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. All wounds and ulcers are offended by Acids, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Inflammation and heat occaſion'd by them. And <hi>Alcali's</hi> perform the cure. 2. Pleuriſies, Quinſies, and all inflammations, are ſtill attended by acute hot Feavers. Now they are the product of Acids, and yield only to <hi>Alcalin</hi> Remedies. 3. The ſame may be ſaid of St. <hi>Antony</hi>'s fire. 4. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting Feavers ſpring from an Acid Crudity prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſtomach, and are only cur'd by abſorbent <hi>Alcali's.</hi> 5. Catarrhous feavers proceed from the Acid ſharpneſs of the <hi>Limpha,</hi> and are cur'd by Volatil temperat Medicines. 6. The Meaſles and Small-pox are attended with a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able heat and Feaver before the eruption. Now the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of an Acid in theſe caſes is plainly evinc'd by the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſion of the Skin, ſuppuration of the Pimples, and method of Cure. 7. Arthritic pains are oft-times uſher'd in by Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh Symptoms. Now, their Cauſe is an Acid, and the cure conſiſts in ſubduing it. 8. The Feavers which follow the ſtopping of an itch or cruſty ſcab in Children, are the natural offspring of the Acids retain'd in the Body, by means of that ſuppreſſion. 9. Hectic Feavers always attend pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent internal Ulcers, which partake of acidity. 10. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are oft-times ſeiz'd with Feavers and gripings, by virtue of the corrupt Acid of the Milk. 11. The high Colour of the Urine in Feavers muſt needs proceed from a prevalent Acid; for <hi>Alcali's</hi> give a contrary Tincture. 12. Immoderat uſe of Wine produces the ſame Symptoms as a Feaver, by means of its Acid Tartareous parts. 13. Hypochondriac perſons are obnoxious to Inflammations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by reaſon of the prevailing Acidity in the firſt paſſages. 14. The Heart-burning reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the Symptoms of a Feaver, and is caus'd by a gnawing Acid in the mouth of the ſtomac. 15. That according to <hi>Tachenius,</hi> the hot vegetable Remedies are proper againſt a predominant Acid; and the cold vegetables againſt an <hi>Alcali.</hi> The plain truth is this. All hot vegetables have a fat roſinous Acid, which if ſet at liberty is notably hot; but if they be digeſted with fix'd Salts, the fat Acid is retain'd by the fix'd Salt, and then they yield a thin meagre Spirit, of noted excellency in hot diſeaſes; as I have often experienc'd by the ſimple Spirit of <hi>Sal-armoniac.</hi> 16. That the pain and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:207638:100"/>heat remaining after burning, proceeds from the keen Acid particles ſhot into the part; and is remov'd by <hi>Alcali's.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some derive the exceſſive heat attending Feavers from the Bile; but ſeveral medicines near ally'd to the Choler expel the heat; and beſides, its Patrons cannot determin whether it ſhould proceed from its <hi>Acid</hi> or <hi>Alcali,</hi> ſince 'tis equally intitled to the poſſeſſion of both.</p>
                     <p>The fourth Symptom is the Alteration of Urine. When the <hi>Chyle</hi> or Blood is viciated, Nature indeavours to diſcharge the Heterogeneous particles by this paſſage; which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly impart to the Urine a high or flat tincture, according to the degree of the peccant Acid; which is equally the Cauſe of this and all other Symptoms attending Feavers.</p>
                     <p>The immediat ſubject of Feavers is the Blood and Spirits. The alteration of Pulſe and Urine clearly infers that the Blood is affected; the Critical Sweats, the <hi>Jaundice,</hi> and ſometimes the Acid tincture of the Blood enſuing Feavers, are plain Demonſtrations of the ſame truth. The feaveriſh tendency of Aches, the efficacy of <hi>Opium</hi> in appeaſing febrile commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the nature of ſome malignant Feavers that produce no notable alteration in the Blood and Urine, make it to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the diſcompoſure of the Spirits is properly call'd a Feaver.</p>
                     <p>From whence I infer, that Heat or Chilneſs are not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to a Feaver; and that the Heart, or any other ſolid part, are not the immediat ſubject. 'Tis true, the febrile ſource may lodge in ſome corrupt or vitiated part, but it only cauſes a Feaver by diſordering the Blood and Spirits. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Cauſe of Feavers ought to be heedfully diſtinguiſh'd from their Effects of the ſame Nature; namely, when in their decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation any ſolid part is ſeiz'd with a ſwelling, obſtruction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the various diſpoſition of the febrile mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the previous infirmity of the part.</p>
                     <p>The various Diviſions of Feavers may be gather'd from the following Chapters. As for their Cauſes; whatever aboliſhes the natural proportion and Symmetry of the Salts, cauſes a preternatural Fermentation, and is call'd a febrile Ferment. If it affect the Blood immediatly, the Spirits receive its influence at ſecond hand; and if the Spirits are firſt attack'd, the Blood is diſorderd by them.</p>
                     <p>This Ferment muſt be ſomewhat diſagreeable to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Ferments, elſe it cannot cauſe a Fever. Such as are the particles retain'd by ſtopping the inſenſible tranſpiration, the Ferment proceeding from Ulcers, Inflammations, Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:207638:100"/>or Acid <hi>Lymph,</hi> ſtriking inwards a Scab or Itch, eating Summer Fruits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If this ferment be ingendred within the Body, it oft-times proceeds from the long ſtay of Victuals in the ſtomac, which by delay and want of digeſtion become na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Acids, or viſcid Bodies incloſing an Acid within 'em; upon which account we derive the cauſe of Intermitting Feavers from the Stomac; and for ſo much as their Parox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yſms are but ſo many continual Feavers, moſt of this ſort acknowledge the ſame Original. When the Blood and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are forc'd out of their reſpective Veſſels by Wounds and Ulcers, they ferment and occaſion a feaveriſh diſorder in the Blood or Spirits.</p>
                     <p>This Ferment approaches to an Acid, both in favourable and malignant Feavers; but with this difference; that a malignant ferment is ſharper and more Volatil and penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting than the other; and is frequently couch'd under covert of other minute particles; as in Spring the Exhalations of Fermenting Plants; in Summer the <hi>Alcalin Effluviums</hi> in the Air; in <hi>Autumn</hi> and Winter, the Acid Salt which then prevails.</p>
                     <p>The ſteams of Rotten Carkaſſes, and the unfavourable aſpects of the Stars may occaſion the like malignity. Theſe particles tho' originally included in a narrow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, multiply by fermentation, and ſpin out the diſeaſe. The alteration occaſion'd by them in the Blood, is perfectly parallel to that of Urine, which is brought into fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the jarring of its Salts, by virtue of which it preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitates its diſproportionable parts, and then returns to a pacific ſtate. Even ſo, the preternatural fermentation of the Blood, is caus'd by the diſproportion of its Salts; and moves it to caſt forth the ſuperfluous and offending parts by the paſſages of Urine, Sweat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Tho' in this Critical Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation, not only the firſt morbific matter, but the lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parts of the Blood and <hi>Chyle,</hi> that the fermentation had melted down into a ſaline form, and render'd inſociable, are equally diſcharg'd.</p>
                     <p>The remote Cauſes are various. The Obſtruction of the pores of the Skin, and exceſſive Drinking or Eating, are natural inlets to a Feaver. The paſſions of the Mind, eſpecially Fear, are generally arraign'd as Cauſes of malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Feavers; but 'tis not immaginable how they ſhould produce ſuch an effect of themſelves. 'Tis true indeed, Fear, and other paſſions, may depreſs or diſorder the Spirits,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:207638:101"/>and ſo procure an eaſie admiſſio nto the Airy Ferment, that was unable to ſtorm them in their natural Order.</p>
                     <p>The Symptoms are accounted for above; to which we may add the vicious increaſe, or diminution, or depravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Appetit; Headachs, ſwoonings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The general Prognoſtics are deriv'd from the Pulſe and Urine. A vehement, large, equal pulſe is a ſign of ſtrength; a ſmall unfrequent pulſe betokens weakneſs: A hard pulſe beſpeaks the inflammation or diſtention of ſome membranous part; as in Pleuriſies, and malignant Feavers, affecting the Spirits and Nerves: A ſoft pulſe diſcovers that the Spirits are not much diſorder'd; and if it be large and vehement withal, forebodes ſweating.</p>
                     <p>Urine affords the ſigns of Crudity or Concoction. If clear Urine become muddy or contain a Cloud or Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 'tis a ſign of Concoction, and portends a happy ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the diſeaſe: for by Concoction we underſtand the ſeparation or precipitation of the peccant Salts from the maſs of Blood, and by Crudity the perturbation of the Blood ariſing from theſe Salts. Now, in the beginning of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Diſeaſes the Urine is clear and unmuddy'd, by reaſon that the Salts are yet reigning in the Blood; but in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the Diſeaſe it becomes thick and troubled, and at the height precipitates a copious ſediment. If the Urine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue muddy, and do's not Clarify by ſtanding, 'tis a ſign that the Commotion and Confuſion of the Blood do's not yet abate. Nature do's not evacuate the offending matter before a ſufficient Concoction; and in imitation of her example, Art ought not to attempt any evacuation in Benign Feavers, before the ſigns of Concoction appear. In malignant Feavers indeed, 'tis not ſafe to wait for 'em; but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour an early precipitation by proper remedies. Clear and ſound-like Urine is a ſign that the animal Spirits are principally affected, and is attended by malignity: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted Urine, if it continue ſuch, is a certain preſage of Recovery. If after an apparent Concoction, it become crude or thin again, 'tis a fatal Omen.</p>
                     <p>This gradual Concoction is the effect of Nature indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring a <hi>Criſis.</hi> Accordingly, we find that immediatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Criſis,</hi> Nature ſtruggles moſt, and the Sickneſs is at its greateſt height, in which caſe it ought not be diſturb'd by artificial adminiſtrations, but the natural tendency of the morbific matter muſt be heedfully obſerv'd; for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times 'tis caſt forth by Sweat, ſometimes by Urine, ſomtimes
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:207638:101"/>by Bleeding, and at other times is thrown upon ſeveral parts of the Body by way of ſwellings and Impoſthumes; or is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd under the skin all over the Body, and tinges it with a yellow colour, which we call the Jaundice, and is a ſign of health, if it happen on the fifth or ſeventh day; but if it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence ſooner, unleſs attended by ſome notable Evacuation, 'tis oft-times fatal. But of all fatal ſigns that of the Patient's rubbing and picking the noſe, without any efflux of matter, is the moſt diſmal.</p>
                     <p>As touching the Method of Cure: 'Tis neceſſary to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh malignant Feavers which ſuddenly weaken the Perſon, and generally determine in ſome notable Evacuations; from thoſe that are benign and favourable, in which we either leave all to Nature, as the ancients did, or anticipat her efforts by enervating and correcting the febrile Ferment with Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Remedies, and ſo aſcribe the whole Cure to Art.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes we joyn iſſue with Nature, and while ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms her Work, are only buſy'd in removing the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that imbarraſs her, by cleanſing the firſt paſſages, emptying the Blood Veſſels, and promoting the precipitation of the morbific matter by Medicines proper for that purpoſe. Indeed when Nature departs from her due Meaſures, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring unſeaſonable evacuations, as in the beginning of a Feaver, while the Urine is yet Crude, a violent Looſneſs, Bleeding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'tis a perplex'd Caſe; for to withſtand Nature, and ſtop the Looſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were to augment the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and to ſuffer it to go on, weakens and diſables the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, ſo that he cannot encounter the Diſeaſe. In order to ſolve this difficult knot, let us conſider in the firſt place, that Nature is forc'd to theſe Evacuations, by the ſharpneſs of the humors, which ought to be corrected by temperat Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines; in the next place, that if they exceed in quantity, they may be ſafely curb'd; or if deficient in quantity, may be gently incourag'd. If the quality of the matter be faulty, that is, if ſuch things are evacuated as ought not to be, 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable to ſtop it, according to <hi>Hipp. Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>Aph.</hi> 2. If both quantity and quality be faultleſs, and the evacuation charg'd with no Crime, but that of its being ill tim'd, it may nevertheleſs prove Critical.</p>
                     <p>Blood-letting is frequently injoyn'd in Feavers, but oft-times it do's more harm than good. The general Plea for it, is, that it ventilats and cools the Blood; whereas on the contrary, the more ſpace be given to the Blood to boyl in, the higher it boyls. In intermitting Feavers, I poſitively aver,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:207638:102"/>that 'tis noxious; in malignant Feavers 'tis next door to cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Patient's Throat. And as touching the continual burning Feavers, it ought to be very cautiouſly gone about, by reaſon of a latent malignity that oft-times attends them. If the Patient be plethoric, young and luſty, if a Vomit could not conveniently be exhibited in the beginning of the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, if any wonted evacuation of Blood be ſtop'd, and ſuch other circumſtances indicate Blood-letting, 'tis well: But however it be, 'tis never ſafe after the third or fourth Day.</p>
                     <p>As for evacuating Remedies <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s <hi>Aphoriſm</hi> is a ſtanding Rule; namely, that <hi>Concocted, not crude humors, ought to be evacuated.</hi> So proper Purgatives are inconvenient till after the height of the diſtemper. Indeed gentle lenitives, that do not reach further than the firſt ways, may be mix'd with digeſtive Salts, and exhibited in the beginning, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, avoiding the time of the Criſis. Vomits are proper in all kinds of Feavers, eſpecially if there be any inclination to Vomit, ſour Belchings, murmuring noiſe in the Guts, Head-ach or Giddineſs. They ought to be Adminiſtred on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the beginning of acute Feavers. In the progreſs of ſlow Feavers they may likewiſe be given.</p>
                     <p>Clyſters are proper for mitigating the Heat, and redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the diſorders of the Head and Guts. But upon the point of Critical Evacuations or Eruptions, they are altogether improper.</p>
                     <p>Sweating Medicines are authoris'd by Nature's Example. They ought to be frequently repeated, and that not only after ſigns of Concoction, but during the whole courſe of the diſeaſe, eſpecially if it be malignant. Such of 'em as are ſharp, aromatic, roſinous, oyly, or Hot, are to be avoided; and thoſe which are temperat, as the fix'd abſorbents, and the thin volatils are only proper for this purpoſe. If ſweat do not eaſily inſue, add Opiats to them. Which are never to be us'd without a ſudorific mixture, nor about the time of the <hi>Criſis,</hi> nor in the very firſt beginning of the diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>In Feavers Sugar and ſweet things ought to be avoided, by reaſon that they promote the Fermentation. Thirſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally attends Feavers, and proceeds from the deficiency of Spittle, and from Alcalin Salts lodg'd in the Palat. 'Tis a vulgar Error to derive it from Heat; for a few drops of Spirit of Sulphur are more efficatious in quenching it, than a whole Gallon of Water or cooling Liquors. Wine is likewiſe of noted efficacy for quenching Thirſt, corrobera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Stomac and Spirits, and promoting Urine. But it
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:207638:102"/>ought to be of a ſharp thin Body; for the ſweet fat Wines from <hi>Spain, Florence,</hi> &amp;c. are hurtful. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> was wont to exhibit Wine in all Feavers; at leaſt in intermitting and malignant Feavers 'tis of ſoveraign uſe. In continual burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Feavers what diſorders it may occaſion are preſently vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and yield to abſorbent Powders; for 'tis not the hot Spirit, but the Acid of the Wine that can do the leaſt harm; nor that neither, but only in ſome particular Conſtitutions.</p>
                     <p>Ale or Beer is not agreeable to feaveriſh Perſons, becauſe the digeſtive faculty of the Stomac being languid, it corrupts and cauſes bitter muſty Belchings. Waters and thin Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors mix'd with Acids are preferable. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Flowers of red Roſes two handfuls; extract a Tincture from them with Water ſharpen'd with Spirit of Sulphur; then add the Syrrup of the Juice of <hi>Gitrons,</hi> or of <hi>Barberries,</hi> or of <hi>Rasberries,</hi> and make a Julep. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take three <hi>Citrons</hi> ſlic'd, and throw upon 'em white Sugar. Then Boyl them in common Water. Take of this Liquor ſtrain'd a Pound and half, freſh juice of <hi>Citrons</hi> three Ounces; Flowers of Roſes and of red Poppies, of each a handful; with a ſmall quantity of dulcify'd Spirit of Salt. Let them ſtand in a warm infuſion, in order to extract a Tincture.</p>
                     <p>In continual Feavers let the Patient drink at pleaſure: But the Liquor muſt not be cold, nor much of it drunk at once. In intermitting Feavers theſe Acid potions, ought not to be Adminiſtred till after the cold Fit. The Spirit of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur with common Water is a proper Liquor both for quenching thirſt and promoting ſweat. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of Whey two Pound, <hi>Citron</hi> Juice three Ounces; Daſies and red Poppy Flowers, of each an Ounce and a half. Boyl in a cloſe Veſſel till the Tincture be extracted. The <hi>Citron</hi> Juice depurates the Whey. It is uſeful in all continual Feavers, and qualifies <hi>Scorbutic</hi> or <hi>Hypochondriac</hi> Salts.</p>
                     <p>As for Diet. They ought to avoid Meat, Fiſhes, and Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Fruits. In a word, let them eat but a little, and as their Appetit requires. What they eat muſt be thin and watry, but never forc'd upon 'em. Broth, <hi>Panado's,</hi> a Toſt in Wine, or at moſt poach'd Eggs are their proper food.</p>
                     <p>Quiet and Reſt are good Signs; and ſleep, if it be not preternatural, compoſes the Spirits and procures Sweat.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>A Feaver is ſtyl'd <hi>Intermitting,</hi> when the fermentation, and agitation of the Blood and Spirits is interrupted, and after a certain interval of time revives again. If it return with equal force every Day, 'tis call'd <hi>Quotidian:</hi> If it return every other Day, leaving an interval of one intire Day, 'tis a <hi>Tertian:</hi> if the interval conſiſt of two Days, 'tis a <hi>Quartan.</hi> Some return after three Days, ſome after four, five, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some every Week, ſome every Month, and ſome every Year; but theſe are very unfrequent.</p>
                     <p>If the fit return twice or thrice in one Day, 'tis call'd a double or treble <hi>Quotidian.</hi> If two Paroxiſms happen eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other Day, or if the intermitting Days of <hi>Tertians</hi> have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Paroxyſms correſponding to one another, 'tis a double <hi>Tertian;</hi> If two Fits come in the Fir Days, and but one in the <hi>Intermitting,</hi> 'tis a treble <hi>Tertian.</hi> If the Fits return e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Day, ſo as that the firſt for duration and other Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms is parallel to the fourth, the ſecond to the fifth, third to the ſixth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'tis a treble <hi>Quartan.</hi> If the Feaver inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit only every third Day, 'tis a double <hi>Quartan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis a hard matter to diſtinguiſh <hi>Quotidians</hi> from double <hi>Tertians.</hi> Theſe laſt are known by this, that either the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſms have an alternat correſpondence, the firſt to the third, ſecond to the fourth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or the intervening Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm comes later, while the other two obſerve their ſet Periods; or in Progreſs of time it intirely diſappears, and two Fits recur every other Day. A precedent or ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſimple <hi>Tertian,</hi> diſcovers likewiſe a double <hi>Tertian.</hi> So that true <hi>Quotidians</hi> are very rare, and ſome are ſo hardy as to deny that there are any ſuch. But ſeveral good Authors have vouch'd for the Affirmative.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome Erratic <hi>Intermitting</hi> Feavers, that obſerve dark Periods peculiar to themſelves; and ſome call'd Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, which have no ſet times at all.</p>
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:207638:103"/>
                     <p>The grand Symptoms of intermitting Feavers are a chill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhivering and ſhaking, follow'd by heat; and that by plentiful Sweats. Before the invaſion of the Paroxyſm, the Patient is moleſted with a Yawning and Stretching; a wearineſs of the Joints, and unquietneſs or toſſing in Bed. The Nails become livid and blue; a gentle chillneſs ſeizes the Loins and Back, afterwards it creeps to the Belly, and by degrees overſpreads the whole Body, eſpecially the extreme Parts. Then follows a ſhivering, and ſometimes a violent concuſſion of all the parts of the Body. During the cold Fit, ſeveral ſorts of pains affect the Joints, the Guts are grip'd, and make a murmuring noiſe; and the Pulſe is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd more frequent, but withal weaker and leſſer, nay ſcarce perceivable.</p>
                     <p>When the coldneſs abates, a difficulty of breathing inſues, with a notable heat and thirſt; the Pulſe is ſtrengthen'd and inlarg'd. (If the Pulſe be ſmall, 'tis a ſign of great Maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.) The Tongue becomes dry, the Neck and Temples are ſeiz'd with a beating heat, attended with frequent reſpiration, head-ach, watching, and ſometimes doating. The heat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining is follow'd by ſweating and voiding Urine. After which ſleep takes place, and the Symptoms diſappear. In <hi>Tertians</hi> the heat and thirſt are greateſt. And in <hi>Quartans,</hi> the cold, ſhaking, and wearineſs of the Joynts are moſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome.</p>
                     <p>This is the ordinary manner of Invaſion. But withal, there are ſome irregular Feavers, that depart from this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. As the cold Feavers that have no hot Fits; and the hot <hi>Tertian</hi> Feavers that are not uſher'd in by cold. Sometimes, but very rarely, the Order is inverted, and the heat precedes the cold Fit. Oft-times theſe Feavers begin regularly, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards degenerate; or on the contrary, begin in a diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner, and by continuation become regular.</p>
                     <p>If the Pulſe be very ſmall, the Strength aboliſh'd, the Breaſt diſturb'd, the Spirits diſquieted, in the beginning of the paroxyſm, and afterwards Puſhes and Spots appear in the Skin, the Feaver is malignant and very dangerous. Tho' ſome are inclin'd to exclude malignity from the whole circle of intermitting Feavers.</p>
                     <p>Tho' intermitting Feavers may differ in their Periods, and ſome occaſional Symptoms, they all proceed from one and the ſame Cauſe, and require the ſame method of Cure; as appears by their frequent permutation. The general effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Cauſe of all Motion is the Spirits; but the occaſional ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:207638:104"/>Cauſe which provokes them to ſuch irregular Motions, is a vicious acid ferment bred in the Stomach and firſt Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, by the depravation or weakneſs of the digeſtive Faculty. This Opinion is juſtified by the preternatural Appetit that ſometimes attends Feavers, the frequent Cures perform'd by Faſting, by exceſſive Drinking and Vomiting, or by eating greedily what was long'd for; and the notable exaſperation or relapſe of the Diſeaſe occaſioned by any error in Diet, or earing unacceptable Food. 'Tis true, ſuch Feavers may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times proceed from the Air, or quality of the Food; but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rarely. The diſorders of the Spleen and Liver do fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently attend <hi>Quartans,</hi> and <hi>Tertians,</hi> but they are rather their Effects, than Cauſes; or perhaps they may remotely indiſpoſe the Body, and render the Paroxyſms more obſtinat. The ſuppreſſion of the Terms, or obſtruction of any part, may produce the like Effects; but ſtill the immediat Cauſe is lodg'd in the Stomac, or firſt Paſſages, which inſinuats it ſelf into the remains of indigeſted Food, and ſo multiplies the Cauſe of repeated Paroxyſms.</p>
                     <p>Now by means of this Acid, all the Symptoms and Periods of Paroxyſms, are thus accounted for. If the Chyle be not well digeſted in the Stomac, and duly ſeparated from the groſſer parts, by the interpoſal of the pancreatic and choleric Juices in the Guts, it degenerates from its temperat, vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, ſaline Quality, and becomes acid, or viſcid; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly when it joins the Blood, fixes its ſaline volatil oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Particles, and thickens the whole Maſs. Thus its fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation is impair'd, and by conſequence the Pulſe is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd and diminiſh'd, but withal render'd more frequent by the irritation of the Heart. The heat of the Body is extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd, and the Spirits diſorder'd by the indiſpoſition and vicious fermentation of the Blood, from whence iſſues the wearineſs of the Joints. When this Acid begins to exert it ſelf, it twitches and contracts the nervous and membranous parts, the Coats of the Guts and Stomach, with the annex'd choleric and pancreatic Veſſels, the fat Membrane or <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niculus Carnoſus,</hi> &amp;c. the natural Conſequences of which are a ſhivering, ſhaking, pains of the Joints, and violent Vomiting of white or green matter, which is nothing elſe but a mixture of the pancreatic and bilious Juices, perverted by this irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar fermentation, and cauſing gripings of the Guts, a coldneſs of the Belly, and many other Symptoms.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Symptoms are allotted only to the beginning of the Paroxyſm. For after that this acid has for ſome time ſtifled
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:207638:104"/>the volatil oyly parts of the Blood, they make head againſt it, and the mutual Encounter creates a notable efferveſcency, which ends in diſcharging the vanquiſh'd acid in a vehicle of attenuated Serum by Urine or Sweat. From hence we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the other Symptoms of heat, burning, the vehemency and largeneſs of the Pulſe, plentiful Sweats, the clearneſs of the Urine at firſt, and its ſubſequent muddineſs. The Acid being thus ſubdu'd and evacuated, the Feaver and concurring Symptoms intermit, till ſuch time as the remaining <hi>Miaſma's</hi> be provok'd afreſh, or ſupplied by new recruits from the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac.</p>
                     <p>If this intermitting ferment be cramp'd by a vicid pituitous Vehicle, the Paroxyſm is longer, and the Symptoms meeker, than when it is maſter of it ſelf, and at liberty to diſplay its utmoſt energy. From whence we gather the difference of acute and chronical, ſpurious and regular Feavers.</p>
                     <p>In theſe Northern Countries, 'tis highly neceſſary to take notice of ſcorbutic and hypocondriac Diſeaſes, as the frequent Companions of intermitting Feavers. Thoſe which we call erratic are always ſcorbutic, unleſs they be caus'd by Impoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humes of the internal parts, which ſeldom happen. The ſigns of a ſcorbutic Feaver are, anxieties of the Breaſt, rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pains of the Joints, floating pains or convulſions of the lower Belly (either before or in the Paroxyſm) vomiting of green or yellow Matter, and the eruption of livid or red Spots towards the end of the Fit; which ſometimes break forth together with the Sweat, and diſappear when it is finiſh'd. But the moſt infallible evidence of a ſcorbutic Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is, when red crumbling clots of Sand ſtick to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom or ſides of the Chamber-pot; or in room of that a fat Cruſt, or a groſs, reddiſh, ſcurfy Sediment appears in the Urine.</p>
                     <p>Periodical Feavers degenerat oft-times from their regular Meaſures, and either anticipat or poſtpone the hour of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning. This may be occaſion'd by the ſtrength or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Spirits, the greater or leſs activity of the febrile ferment, or viſcidity of its Vehicle.</p>
                     <p>As for their frequent multiplication, or the degeneracy of ſimple Feavers into double, triple, quadruple, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'tis oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd either by a prepoſterous uſe of fixing Medicines, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piats, or Purgatives; or by eating Fiſh, Summer-fruits, Milks, and over-feeding juſt before the Paroxyſm.</p>
                     <p>The Diagnoſtics are couch'd in the preceding Paragraphs. As for Prognoſticks; a <hi>Tertian,</hi> if regular and well manag'd,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:207638:105"/>do's not exceed ſeven Fits; but a <hi>Quartan,</hi> tho' more tedious, is leſs dangerous. Malignant intermitting Feavers are juſtly ſuſpected. The ſpurious <hi>Tertians,</hi> or ſuch as begin meekly and ſlowly, are worſe to cure than the regular acute ones; and for the moſt part drive out to the fourteenth Paroxyſm. All benign intermitting Feavers are eaſily cur'd, if taken care of betimes; but if neglected, they become chronical, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generat into grievous Diſtempers. If the Urine, voided out of the Paroxyſm, thicken apace, it ſignifies the ſhortneſs of the Diſeaſe. If at firſt it appear crude, and ſoon after aſſume a white Cloud, the Feaver will end with the fourth Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm. But if it continue ſcanty, reddiſh, and unconcocted, the Feaver will laſt to the ſeventh Fit; or, if diſcontinu'd, is apt to relapſe. If all the Symptoms are heighten'd in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Paroxyſm of a <hi>Tertian,</hi> and relent in the third, the fourth concludes the Feaver; but if their heighth be put off till the fourth, and their remiſſion to the fifth, the ſeventh is the finiſhing ſtroak. While a <hi>Tertian</hi> anticipates its hours, it increaſes; and declines when it begins to poſtpone. <hi>Schir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>'s in the Bowels ſucceeding to intermitting Feavers, are ſad preſages of chronical Diſtempers. Such Feavers as obſerve regular conſtant Periods, are more obſtinate than thoſe which vary. Vomiting is a good ſign; and Convulſions in the Fit are not to be fear'd. When a copious Sweat ſucceeds to the Paroxyſm, oft-times there's no ſediment in the Urine; and in that caſe there's no bad indication; but if otherwiſe, 'tis juſtly ſuſpicious.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Quotidians,</hi> they are apt to continue forty Days or longer. If attended by a heavineſs of the Head and drowſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they terminat in a Lethargy or Carus. If they are ſipun out to a conſiderable length, they degenerat into Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and other grievous Diſtempers. If the Paroxyſms in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade by Day, 'tis a worſe caſe than if they came by Night; and if they continue long without Sweating, while the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petit and Strength of the Perſon are very languid, there's ſmall hope of recovery. If the Paroxyſms be ſhort, attended by Vomiting in the beginning, and early ſigns of Concoction in the progreſs of the Diſeaſe, 'tis a good Omen. Sometimes <hi>Quotidians</hi> are ſolv'd by frequent Vomiting, pituitous eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations by Stool, or a tranſlation of the febril matter to the Joints.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Quartan</hi> after the ſixtieth Year of one's Age is mortal. It may continue for two and twenty Years together, but the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt meaſure of its regular duration is one Year. If its Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:207638:105"/>be conſtant and regular, they portend ill; if inconſtant, they betoken a ſudden recovery. An Autumnal Quartan continues till the Spring Equinox, and then for the moſt part ceaſes of its own accord. A Vernal Quartan, if it do not diſappear at the Summer Solſtice, reaches to the Autum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Equinox. The duration of Autumnal and Winter Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans is longer than that of the Summer ones. Women are oft-times freed from this Feaver, by being got with Child. If it be attended by the diſorder of any Bowel, it introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a Dropſy o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> obſtinate Scurvy. If it dwell long in a dry Conſtitution, it ends in a Hectic or Conſumption. An irregular Diet, eſpecially in reſpect of drinking, adds to its duration. Loſs of Appetit is a very bad ſign. Black U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, tho' a dangerous Symptom in other Diſeaſes, ſignifies the ſolution of a Quartan, unleſs it be attended by a notable weakneſs, for then it is a ſign of approaching Death.</p>
                     <p>A Jaundice in the beginning of a <hi>Tertian</hi> or <hi>Quartan,</hi> is an unlucky Sympom; but if it happen later, may infer a ſolution of the Diſeaſe. <hi>Tertians</hi> are ſometimes cur'd by Critical Eruptions in the Lips, Noſtrils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſometimes by long faſting; but the moſt effectual way is that of ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>Now, in order to anſwer all the indications of Cure, let the following Cautions be carefully weigh'd.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. That by all means the Cure be commenc'd betimes, for intermitting Feavers by delay become obſtinat.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. In theſe Countries, Blood-letting does but prolong 'em. Perhaps ſome occaſional Circumſtances may juſtifie the uſe of it in a few particular caſes; but in general, this is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſted Maxim, that whatever impairs the Heat, or does not promote Sweating; is hurtful.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Vomiting is abſolutely neceſſary in all intermitting Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, eſpecially <hi>Quartans;</hi> and ought to be repeated, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion requires. Let a Vomit therefore be exhibited two or three Hours before the invaſion of the Paroxyſm, unleſs the weakneſs of the Perſon diſſuade; in which caſe, give it the Day immediatly preceding. The ſymptomatical Vomitings that oftentimes happen in the Paroxyſm, are ſo far from arguing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Artificial Vomits, that they are a plain indication for 'em. If the Perſon be troubled with a bitter nauſeating taſte in the Mouth in a Morning, or complain of ſtraitneſs of the Breaſt, Heart-burrings, Unquietneſs, Giddineſs, Belch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a Vomit is loudly demanded. In fine, in <hi>Quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians;</hi> and all other Intermitting Feavers, it is a ſovereign Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy;
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:207638:106"/>but withal, care muſt be taken, that the Stomac be not over-weaken'd; upon which account, let the following mixture be given after the operation of the Vomit.</p>
                     <p>Take of Rasberry-Water, one Ounce; ſtrong Cinnamom-Water, two Drams; Confection <hi>Alkermes,</hi> half a Dram; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> one grain; Simple Syrup of <hi>Poppies,</hi> two or three Drams. Mix for the above mention'd uſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aſarabecca</hi> is a noted Vomit, eſpecially in <hi>Quartans.</hi> A Dram or Four Scruples of the Powder of <hi>Aſarabecca</hi> Roots may be given, with eight or ten Grains of <hi>Sal-armoniac,</hi> in a draught of White-wine, an Hour or two before the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm; it procures both vomiting and ſweating. Or Eight or Nine Leaves, cut not very ſmall, may be infus'd over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night in <hi>Carduus Benedictus</hi> Water, and exhibited in the Morning with <hi>Oxymel.</hi> If the Leaves be beat in a Mortar 'till their Juice be expreſs'd, and that mix'd with <hi>Oxymel</hi> and Water of <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> they yield a more powerful Vomit. If the leaves be boil'd in Water, they're ſtrip'd of the vomiting vertue, and become Diuretic, but withal are highly uſeful in <hi>Quartan</hi> Feavers. The Water of Tobacco, and the Roots of Swallow-wort boyl'd in Wine and Water, are likewiſe approv'd Vomits in theſe caſes.</p>
                     <p>But of all the vomiting Tribe, Antimonials are the beſt; as the Infuſion of <hi>Crocus Metallorum;</hi> or take of <hi>Mercurius vitae,</hi> five or ſix Grains; infuſe in Rheniſh, or Wormwood-Wine for the ſpace of a Night, ſtrain out the Wine, and give an Ounce or ten Drams for a doſe. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Mynſicthius</hi> his <hi>Emetic Tartar,</hi> two or three Grains; Sal-armoniac, twelve or fifteen Grains; mix and exhibit in a warm Vehicle. Or if Pills be more acceptable, take of <hi>Ruffus</hi>'s Pills <hi>de tribus,</hi> fifteen Grains; <hi>Mynſicthius</hi>'s <hi>Emetic Tartar,</hi> two or three Grains; Scammony ſulphurated, one Grain; with Eſſence of Leſſer Centory make Pills.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sala</hi>'s Emetic Syrup may be given in any convenient Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle, from three to ſix Drams. Salt of Vitriol is very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive to the Stomac. The Pairings of Man's Nails is a Horſe-Vomit.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. All Purgations in the beginning of Intermitting Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, or while the Urine is yet crude, are hurtful; nay, in the height of the Diſtemper, when the Urin begins to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear muddy, fierce Purgatives may do a great deal of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. If Vomits do not ſucceed, or the firſt paſſages be ſtuff'd with Humors, gentle Purgatives may be exhibited after the third or fourth Paroxyſm, either on the Intermitting
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:207638:106"/>Day, or the Fit day, ſo as that the operation may be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd before the invaſion of the Fit. As</p>
                     <p>Take of Tartar vitriolated, twelve or fifteen Grains; Scammony ſulphurated, three Grains; Troches Alhardal, two Grains; diſtill'd Oil of Aniſeeds or of Cloves, two drops. Mix for a gentle purging Powder.</p>

                     <p>Take of Powder of Jalap, fifteen Grains; Scammony ſulphurated, three Grains; depurated Nitre, four Grains; Salt of Tartar, two Grains. Make a Powder.</p>
                     <p>If Infuſions be more acceptable; Take of pick'd Senna, three or four Drams; Aniſeeds bruis'd, a Dram; Salt of Tartar, half a Dram. Infuſe for the ſpace of one Night, in a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Carduus Benedictus</hi> Water. To three Ounces of the ſtrain'd Liquor, add Cinnamom-Water, and Syrup of Apples, of each half an Ounce. Mix for a Potion. It taſtes prettily, and purges very gently.

                     <p>Take of pick'd Senna; an Ounce; crude Roots of Black Hellebor, two Drams; of Polypody of the Oak, three Drams; Salt of Tartar, half a Dram; boil them gently in clarifi'd Whey. To Four Ounces of the ſtrain'd Liquor, add Tincture of Tartar, a Scruple; compound Syrup of Fumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, half an Ounce. Mix as above.</p>
                     <p>Take of pick'd Senna, an Ounce; crude Black Hellebor and Ginger, of each two Drams; of the ſharpeſt Salt of Tartar, half a Dram; tie them into a Bag, which infuſe in warm Water in a cloſe Veſſel. Let it ſtand 'till it cool, and reſerve the Infuſion in a Cellar for uſe; of which, let the Patient take a large draught every fit day, about two Hours before the Paroxyſm, and likewiſe in the Intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Days, eſpecially in <hi>Quartans.</hi>

                        <pb n="222" facs="tcp:207638:112"/>XXIII. The chilneſs, ſhivering, ſhaking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cold Fits, are admirably accounted for by applying Aromatic Oyls to the Stomac, Breaſt, Back-bone, Loins, and Soles of the Feet. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of Balſam of Peru, a dram; the diſtill'd Oyls of Cloves, of Mace, and of Amber, of each half a ſcruple. Mix and Anoint the above mentioned Parts.</p>
                     <p>Take of expreſs'd Oyl of Nutmegs, a dram; diſtill'd Oyl of Cloves, diſtill'd Oyl of Cinnamom, of each fifteen grains. Mix <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of the diſtill'd Oyl of Juniper-Berries and Roſemary, a ſcruple; diſtill'd Oyl of Cloves half a ſcruple.</p>
                     <p>Inwardly the ſame ſymptoms are mitigated by exhibiting the fixed Salts, Aromatic extracts and diſtill'd Aromatic Oyls. But they are peculiarly calculated for ſuch Feavers where the cold Symptoms are more violent than the hot. The forms of preſcribing are ſuch as theſe.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Salt of Wormwood a ſcruple; prepar'd Oyſter-ſhells and white Pepper in Powder, of each ſix or ſeven grains.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> fifteen grains. Cloves and white Pepper, of each five grains. Make a Powder for two Doſes. To be taken before the invaſion of the Fit.</p>
                     <p>Take of prepar'd Pearl half a ſcruple; Salt of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, fifteen grains; diſtill'd Oyl of Cloves, two drops. Make a Powder.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Salt of Wormwood, fifteen grains; Diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retic Antimony half a ſcruple; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> one grain; diſtill'd Oyl of Cloves, two drops. Make a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be taken two or three Hours before the Fit.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Crollius</hi>'s ſpecific againſt Feavers, a dram: Salts of Wormwood and of leſſer Centory, of each half a ſcruple; diſtill'd Oyl of Cloves, three drops. Make a Powder for two Doſes.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Carduus Benedictus</hi> Water, an ounce; Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mom Water, a dram; extract of Gentian, half a dram; Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> half a dram; Syrup of <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> two drams. Make a draught to be exhibited two Hours before the Fit. In Quartans, when the cold Symptoms prevail moſt, the Doſe of the Extract may be augmented; but in Tertians, when the Heat obtains the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant, the Quantity of the Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi> ought to be inlarg'd.</p>
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:207638:112"/>
                     <p>Take of the Extracts of Wormwood, <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> leſſer Centory, and Triacle, of each from five to ſix Grains; diſtill'd Oil of Cloves three Drops. Make Pills to be given before the Fit, when cold and its Appendants prevail, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no heat inſues. For Oil of Cloves is an incomparable Antidote againſt ſhivering. <hi>Laudanum Opiatum</hi> and Extract of Troches Alhandal are proper Ingredients for the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                     <p n="24">XXIV. If the heat and its Conſequences be more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome than the coldneſs, <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> or its urinous Spirit, is the only proper Medicine. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> a Scruple; <hi>Poterius</hi>'s Antihectic Ponder half a Scruple. Mix, and make a Pouder to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before the Fit.</p>
                     <p>If a raging heat ſucceeding to the cold Fit be attended by a notable proſtration of Strength, ſhort Breathing, a quick frequent and ſmall Pulſe, Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> mix'd with Vinegar and Crabs-eyes will readily give relief. If attended by Heart-burnings, gnawings of the Stomac, Unquietneſs, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety of the Breaſt, imminent Suffocation, as it frequently oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs in Hypocondriac, Hyſteric, and Scorbutic Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the ſame Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> is proper to be given, after premiſing Vomits or Clyſters, according to the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Patient; and in the mean while 'tis not amiſs to apply a Plaiſter of Tacamahac, mix'd with Oil of Amber or Balſam of Peru to the region of the Stomac.</p>
                     <p n="25">XXV. In Chronical Quartans, let the Phyſician inquire if there be any ſchirrous Swelling in the Bowels, or hardneſs in the <hi>Hypocondria;</hi> if Wind moleſt the Guts, or ſcorbutic Symptoms beſet the Body: for theſe Symptoms muſt be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly accounted for, before the Feaver can be cur'd; which generally in this caſe ends in the eruption of the Itch or Scab.</p>
                     <p n="26">XXVI. In ſtubborn Quartans, the Spaw-waters are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, provided the Stomac and Bowels be regular and in good order. Otherwiſe Chalybeat Medicines are more proper. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Eſſence of Wormwood half a Dram; ſolution of Steel in the Juice of Apples a Dram. Mix them to be given before the Fit.</p>
                     <p>Steel and its Productions are of excellent uſe in all Hyſteric, <hi>Hypocondriac,</hi> ſplenetic and ſcorbutic Conſtitutions. It not only removes the obſtructing Acid in the Bowels,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:207638:113"/>which the Jeſuits Powder would ſix and ſettle, but mitigats the impetuoſity of the Fit, which Anodyns do only pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liat and ſoment.</p>
                     <p n="27">XXVII. Tho Chronical Agues may ſeem to be diſcuſs'd, by reaſon of the diſappearance of the Fit, yet 'tis adviſable not to deſiſt for ſome time from a ſpare and cautious Diet, and the uſe of the more noted <hi>Febrifuga's,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Sal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac,</hi> Salt of Hartſhorn, volatil Salt of Amber, volatil Salt of Vipers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for that ofttimes they relapſe after the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuation of ſeveral Weeks.</p>
                     <p>If theſe Remarks be heedfully minded, the Cure of Agues will prove eaſy and ſafe; and many fatal Symptoms which inſue an untimely ſuppreſſion of the Fits, or any other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly part of Cure, will be effectually prevented.</p>
                     <p>As for the Scorbutic Feavers that I've ſo frequently menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, 'tis to be remark'd, that if the Scurvy be not directly taken care of, 'twill be impoſſible to compaſs the Cure of the Feaver. For which purpoſe the Spirit of Scurvy-graſs and <hi>Mynſicthius</hi>'s <hi>Arcanum Duplicatum</hi> are noted ſpecifics; they may be mix'd with other Ingredients, as follows.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Quercetanus</hi>'s Antiſcorbutic Water an Ounce; Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> half a Dram; Spirit of Scurvy-graſs, a Scruple; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum</hi> one or two Grains; <hi>Foreſtus</hi>'s Antiſcorbutical Syrup two Drams. Mix them to be exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited before the Fit, after the univerſal Evacuations are premis'd.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Water of <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> and Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowe-water, of each two Ounces; Spirit of Scurvy-graſs, two Drams; Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> a Dram; <hi>Mynſicthius</hi> his <hi>Arcanum Duplicatum</hi> a Scruple; prepar'd red Coral fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Grains, <hi>Foreſtus</hi> his Antiſcorbutical Syrup an Ounce. Mix as above.</p>
                     <p>Take of Mint Water, Fennel Water, Fumitory Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Carminative Water, of each an Ounce; Spirit of Scurvy-graſs, Spirit of <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle, of each a Dram; dulcify'd Spirit of Nitre twelve Drops; prepar'd Crabs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eyes half a Dram; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum</hi> a Grain and a half; Syrup of Orange Peel ſix Drams. Mix, and give a ſpoonful now and then, in the very time of the Fit. It is of wonderful uſe in ſcorbutic Feavers attended by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream heat, ſtraitneſs of the Breaſt, Wind, violent pains in the Joints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>Whey of Goats-milk, impregnated with the virtue of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſcorbutic Herbs, is a proper Liquor both for reſtaining the heat and conquering the Scurvy or it may be mix'd with gentle Laxatives, by reaſon that Scorbutic Feavers are attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a conſtipation of the Belly. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of Tamarinds, half an ounce; Boyl them in Whey. Then ſtrain the Whey and add of the Ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Milk mix'd with Sugar or Spirit of <hi>Sal-armoniac,</hi> is very proper before and after the Paroxyſm.</p>
                     <p>From what has been ſaid upon the whole matter, we may gather the general method of curing intermitting Feavers into this form. Firſt the Stomac muſt be prepar'd with a Digeſtive Powder or two; then a Vomit muſt be exhibited before the Fit, or a Laxative adminiſtred on the intermitting Day. Afterwards volatil Alteratives, or chalybeat Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines given during the time of intermiſſion, according as the Symptoms require; and in the time of the Fit, the precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating <hi>Alcali</hi>'s both volatil and fix'd; of which Claſs are the bitter Herbs, partaking ſomething of an aromatic Virtue, ſuch as Wormwood, leſſer Centory, Fumitory, <hi>Carduus Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictus,</hi> Chamomil, Celandin, Gentian, Zedoary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They are us'd by way of Powder, Decoction, expreſs'd Juice, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, or in the form of a fix'd Salt. In Powder ſome give a Dram of the Flowers of leſſer Centory, or of <hi>Carduus Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictus, &amp;c.</hi> As for Decoctions, thoſe of a few Ingredients are infinitely the beſt. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Leaves of <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> a handful or two; of <hi>Aſarabecca</hi> roots, an Ounce; infuſe them for the ſpace of a Night in four Pints of Water, then boil away the third part: Let the Patient take three or four Ounces of this Decoction w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:207638:114"/>
                     <p>The Juice of Wormwood exhibited in Wormwood-wine ſome Hours before the Paroxyſm, is much approv'd. The Extracts of theſe bitter Herbs, are likewiſe frequently gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, both during the time of intermiſſion, and a few Hours before the Fit. Or an Eſſence may be prepar'd thus,</p>
                     <p>Take of the tops of leſſer Centory and Wormwood, of each three handfuls; of the Leaves of Mouſe-Ear, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarabecca,</hi> of each two handfuls; of the Herbs Cinquefoil, Hore-hound, Rue, <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> of Water. <hi>German<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> of each a handful; tops of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Wort, half an Ounce; Roots of Celandin, Dandelion, <hi>Angelica,</hi> Zedoary, Gentian, Maſter-wort, white Dittany, Devil's-bit, Fearn, and round-rooted Birth-wort, of each an Ounce; Cloves and Ounce; long Pepper ſix Drams; Ginger, half an Ounce. Extract the Eſſence with Spirits of Wormwood, <hi>Carduus Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictus,</hi> and leſſer Centory. Doſe forty or fifty drops to be given on the intermitting day. But the Vegetable Salts prepar'd from theſe Herbs, together with Spirit of <hi>Sal-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac,</hi> are much beyond any other Medicines.</p>
                     <p>The Jeſuit's Bark is commonly join'd to the vegetable train of ſpecifics. The ways of uſing it are as follows.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Jeſuit's Powder, from a Dram to two Drams. Infuſe them for the ſpace of a Night, in two or ſix Ounces of Rheniſh or <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wine; in the Morning, ſhake them together, and let the Perſon drink it warm before the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Fit.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Jeſuit's Powder, ſix or eight Drams; Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Roots, three Drams; Flowers of leſſer Centory, four little handfuls; long Pepper, a Dram; Salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> half an Ounce. Mix for a Powder.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Jeſuit's Powder ſix Drams; Gentian roots and filings of Steel, of each three Drams; Cloves, a Dram and half. Mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of the Powder of <hi>Kinkina,</hi> a ſcruple; prepar'd Crab's Eyes, a ſcruple; Cardamoms and Cubebs, of each three grains. Mix, and give it before the Paroxyſm.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Powder of Kinkina, ſix Drams; Guaja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, two or three Drams; tops of leſſer Contory, a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; Cinnamom, two Drams; Cloves and Crab's Eyes, of each a Dram; Salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> three Drams; make a Bag, to be infus'd in Rheniſh or Wormwood Wine. Of which, let a Draught be exhibited after the appearance of the ſigns of Concoction, ſome Hours before the Paroxyſm.</p>
                     <p>But 'tis a fallacious Remedy, and ought not to be exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:207638:114"/>'till after the general Evacuations; and if the Body be not purged after the diſcuſſion of the Diſeaſe by this Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, 'twill relapſe after ſome time.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, 'tis an effectual Remedy in <hi>Tertian</hi> and <hi>Quartan</hi> Feavers; but ſince 'tis an exotic Plant, our domeſtic Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian may ſupply its want. If two or three drams of the Powder of Gentian, or a dram of its thicken'd Juice be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Wine about an hour before the Fit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it equals the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of the Jeſuit's Powder. Myrrh and Caſtor are noted ſpecifics in <hi>Quartan</hi> and Scorbutic Feavers. They are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from a Scruple to half a Dram in Wine before the Fit. Some give forty or fifty drops of the Bezoardic Tincture, in Wormwood Wine, together with chalybeat diaphoretic Antimony, or <hi>Timaeus</hi>'s pearl'd Powder, immediately before the Fit. Shells calcin'd, and burrnt Hearts-horn, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in like manner, with good ſucceſs. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of Nutmegs, Nitre, and Allum, of each a Dram. Make a Powder for three Doſes. Of which, let the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent take one before every Fit, being prepar'd to ſweat.</p>
                     <p>Take of prepar'd Red Coral, half a Dram; ſugar of Lead twelve or fifteen grains; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> one grain. Mix, and exhibit in the decoction of <hi>Carduus Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictus</hi> before the Fit, and continue the uſe till the Feaver be diſcuſs'd.</p>
                     <p>The congeal'd Spirits of Salt, and <hi>Vitriol,</hi> Fulminatory Gold, and Salt of Antimony, are much approv'd. The Salt of Antimony may be thus prepar'd. Take diaphoretic An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, and digeſt it in Vinegar ſharpen'd with Spirit of Vitriol, in a moderat heat. Then ſtrain and evaporat the Sugar, and ye will find a Salt or Vitriol, which may be further ſubtilis'd by diſſolving it in Spirit of Wine, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaporating. If ye mix this Salt with Flowers of Antimony; it proves an incomparable Medicin againſt Feavers.</p>
                     <p>But we ought to remark, that all theſe ſix'd Specifics are offenſive to the Stomac and Appetit, and Enemies to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtive faculty; and if unſeaſonably adminiſtred, are fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by Relapſes, or Scirrhus's in the Bowels: wherefore the paſſages ought to be well cleans'd before we attempt to preſcribe 'em; and when we do, they ought to be mix'd with other ſudorifics. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Carduus Benedictus</hi> Water, two Ounces: <hi>Stro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belbergerus</hi>'s ſpecific Powder, half a Dram; volatil Salt of Harts-horn, ſix grains; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> one grain. Mix, and exhibit before the Fit. For a Hyſteric <hi>Tertian,</hi>
                        <pb n="228" facs="tcp:207638:115"/>after the common premiſes, I've preſcrib'd the following Powder with very good ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>Take of prepar'd Harts-horn, half a Dram; Salt of Wormwood, a ſcruple; prepar'd red Coral, twelve grains; Extract of Caſtor, five grains; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> two grains. Make a Powder for two Doſes. To be frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repeated and taken before the Fit. After the Feaver is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs'd by theſe Specifics, 'tis expedient to purge the Body thus;</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Quercetanus</hi>'s Pills of Ammoniac, twelve grains; Extract of Wormwood, ſix or eight grains; Extract of <hi>Troches Alhandal,</hi> two grains. Make Pills.</p>
                     <p>If a relapſe happen, give <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi> mix'd with <hi>Pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>'s <hi>Antihectic</hi> Powder, or prepar'd Coral, before the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of the Paroxyſm.</p>
                     <p>Some commend <hi>Vitriol</hi> as a good ſpecific. But above all, the fix'd Salts are beſt, which are preferable to any other preparation of the vegetable Specifics; Brimſtone or Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder given from half a dram to a whole one, in Vinegar or ſharp Wine, is much approv'd. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of ſix'd Nitre, half a Dram; Flowers of Sulphur, three Drams; Flowers of <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> one dram; Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Red Sanders, ſix drams; white Sugar, two drams. Doſe a dram and a half, to be taken before the Fit.</p>
                     <p>Opium is of noted vertue in intermitting Feavers; upon which account, <hi>Galen</hi> and his Followers, were wont to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle with juice of Wormwood. But it ought not to be exhibited before the Concoction be in ſome meaſure advanc'd. In caſe of a prevailing Heat, it may be exhibited in Vinegar.</p>
                     <p n="27">XXVII. Having thus accounted for the direct Cure of intermitting Feavers, it remains to take a view of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences. <hi>Quartan</hi> or Chronical Feavers are oft-times fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by a ſchirrus of the Spleen or Meſentery, or a tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the Hypochondriac illneſs. Now, to prevent this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, 'twill be needful to join chalybeat or ſplene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Medicines to the common ſpecifics. The Extract of Steel prepar'd with juice of Apples, or its liquid Eſſence mixd with Spirit of Scurvy-graſs, or the tincture of <hi>Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol</hi> of Steel, are proper for this purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Beſides internal Medicins, ſome are wont to make uſe of external helps. The ſymptom of Heat, may be abated by an Epithema of Roſe-Vinegar, Juice of Houſe-leek and Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre; or a Cataplaſm of Yeſt, Salt and Vinegar applied to
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:207638:115"/>the Feet. The material cauſe of the Feaver is in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure evacuated by the application of Bliſtering, or Corroſive Ingredients; ſome apply cataplaſms of Garlic, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyons, Saffron, Vinegar and white Pepper; juſt before the Fit, to the Wriſts. Some mix bruis'd Sage-leaves with Soot and the yelk of an Egg; others Salt, Hopps, and Raiſms, for the ſame purpoſe. Some put a dram or two of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phir, in a Bag, and faſten it to the pit of the Breaſt, 'till it be exhal'd. Others apply the following Plaiſter to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac.</p>
                     <p>Take of Hony, two Ounces; Maſtic and Turpentin, of each half an Ounce; boil the Hony to a due conſiſtency; then mix it with the other Ingredients for a Plaiſter. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of Shining Soot, an Ounce and a half; Turpentin, ſix drams; Spider's Webbs, an Ounce; Camphyr, two ſcruples; with Oyl of Scorpions, make a Plaiſter, to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Wriſts.</p>
                     <p>Oyl of Spiders, living Spiders, and all their preparations are much in uſe. In malignant and <hi>Quartan</hi> Feavers, the following Plaiſter is very ſucceſsful.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Venice</hi> Turpentin, an Ounce; melt it in a Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Kettle; then throw in twenty or thirty living Spiders; ſtir them about with a wooden Spatula, 'till the Spiders be cover'd. Then add of the Powder of Toad's-fleſh dry'd, Powder of red Land-Toads, dry'd, of each an Ounce; crude <hi>Tartar,</hi> an Ounce; Savin, two or ſix drams. With Oyl of Scorpions make a Plaiſter.</p>
                     <p>If we ſuſpect any ſwelling of the Spleen or Bowels, 'tis proper to apply to the region thereof, the Plaiſter of Hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, or of Tobacco, or <hi>Vigo</hi>'s Plaiſter with Mercury mix'd with Gum <hi>Ammoniac.</hi> The thicken'd juice or extract of Tobacco is conducive to this purpoſe, as alſo <hi>Sylvius</hi>'s Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minative Plaiſter. If the region of the <hi>Spleen</hi> or Belly be moleſted with pains, apply what follows.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Extract of Tobacco prepar'd by decoction, three Ounces: <hi>Opium</hi> diſſolv'd in Wine, and reduc'd to the conſiſtence of an Extract, one Ounce; Wax, half a pound. With Turpentine and Oil of Tobacco, make a Plaiſter.</p>
                     <p>Having thus diſpatch'd the regular cure of Feavers, 'twill not be improper to propoſe ſome method of relief for thoſe, who by an unſeaſonable and unskilful ſuppreſſion of the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, are liable to frequent relapſes, convulſive pains in the Belly, Head-aches, Aſthma's, wearineſs of the Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In this caſe, let the Body be render'd ſoluble by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction

Mix for a Draught, and continue the uſe for ſome time. If any ſwelling or violent pain continue in the <hi>Hypogaſtria,</hi> apply the Plaiſter of Gum-Ammoniac and of Galbanum, with Oyl of Bricks. After the ſymptoms are gone, 'tis advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, to continue for ſome time the uſe of Wormwood, or ſuch Remedies as partake of it.</p>

                        <p>THE continual Feavers that laſt above one day, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>primary,</hi> or ſymptomatical. The former are a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe ſubſiſting by it ſelf, which, if its period be ſhort, and its Symptoms grievous, is call'd <hi>Acute;</hi> if it be ſlow-pac'd, and advance without any notable diſturbance, 'tis call'd a <hi>Slow Feaver.</hi> Both of which are call'd Compounds, or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riodical continual <hi>Feavers,</hi> if they admit of any remiſſion, or exacerbation in their continued progreſs. But if their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence be ſtill the ſame, they are call'd ſimple <hi>Synochus</hi>'s.</p>
                        <p>If <hi>Acute</hi> Feavers come without the inflammation of any particular part, they are call'd <hi>Solitary.</hi> And if diſmal Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms happen, beyond the apparent reach of the Feaver, 'tis ſtil'd Malignant: But if otherwiſe, <hi>Benignity</hi> is its Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
                        <p>The primary, ſimple, continual, ſolitary, hot, benign Feavers are caus'd by the prevalency of a volatil, oyly, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Salt in the Maſs of Blood, that hotly encounters the acid Particles, creates a violent motion and Heat, accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates the Pulſe, tinctures the Urine, and while the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is undetermin'd, renders it thin and crude; but when theſe volatil parts are ſubdu'd, and precipitated by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid, the Urine depoſits a ſediment, and affords the true ſigns of Concoction.</p>
                        <p>The remote cauſe, for the moſt part, is the depravation of the Chyle, occaſion'd by the defect of the Choler, or a faulty digeſtion in the Stomac; for the ſtomachic digeſtion is the Mother and ſource of all the fermentations of the other Juices in the Body. Now the vicious heterogeneous Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles convey'd in the Chyle to the Blood, diſturb its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural fermentation, and provoke its conſtituent parts to riſe up, in order to expel the Hoſtile Intruders. Thus we ſee that thoſe, whoſe Blood is well ſtock'd with bilious Particles, whoſe Conſtitution is foul, corpulent, and plethoric, who
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:207638:117"/>feed high, and drink ſtrong Liquors, are moſt liable to this preternatural fermentation. In like manner, whatever ſtops the inſenſible tranſpiration, accumulats oily Particles in the Blood, and exalts the Spirits, does pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>
                           </gap>iſpoſe the Blood for receiving a feaveriſh impreſſion.</p>
                        <p>The Cauſe of acute, compound, periodical Feavers, is ſome vicious acid juice, proceeding from the Stomac, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning by intervals, while the volatil oily Ferment conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues its courſe without intermiſſion. They are, as it were, compounded of a Continual Acute Feaver, and an Intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one, which is always a <hi>Tertian;</hi> for <hi>Quotidian</hi> and <hi>Quartan</hi> continued periodical Feavers (if any ſuch there be) are rather ſlow than acute. This Compound ſort of Acute Feavers, is oft-times attended by a notable heat, without any ſhivering.</p>
                        <p>If an inſufferable thirſt, drineſs of the Tongue, Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aches, Deliriums, a high tincture and muddineſs of Urine, attend a continual Feaver, 'tis call'd a <hi>Cauſus</hi> or Burning Feaver. The cauſe of theſe Symptoms is the hot ingagement of a ſharp volatil Acid, with the volatil oily Particles. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the ſtomachic ferment being vitiated, and unqualifi'd for its wonted Office, the contents of the Stomac degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat into an alcalin oily texture, which ſticks to its Pleats, irritats the Membranes of the Gullet, and, by conſent, the Tongue it ſelf: And moreover, when it joins the Blood, impregnats the Lymph which waters the Throat, and is voided by way of Spittle, with a volatil only Salt. And if this vicious <hi>Saliva</hi> ſtick to the Tongue and Throat, it becomes troubleſome and inflaming; cauſing in theſe parts a redneſs, hear, and pain, known by the name of <hi>Prunella.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Continual Acute Feavers are ſtyl'd, <hi>Lipyria</hi>'s, when the ſuperficial parts of the Body are moleſted with a ſenſe of Cold, while thoſe within are beſet with a violent Heat. They proceed for the moſt part from the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If there be any ſuch thing as a primary <hi>Lipyria,</hi> the ſenſe of external Cold muſt proceed from the irritation of the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous membranous parts, and that of inward heat from the pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ernatural fermentation of the Blood.</p>
                        <p>If a Continual Acute Feaver be attended by a Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or colliquation of the fat oily parts of the Body, and a tendency to a Maraſmus, 'tis call'd a <hi>Melting</hi> Feaver. Theſe oily far nutritious juices are voided either by ſtool
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:207638:117"/>in the form of ſtinking Excrements, or by a cool glutinous Sweat, or by copious quantities of Urine, whoſe ſurface is cover'd with far, or by falling into the cavity of the Belly, or upon the Feet after a Hydropic manner.</p>
                        <p>The Cauſes of melting Feavers are, the thin open texture of the nutritious juice and fat, occaſion'd by the want of a fixing congealing Acid; The Acrimony of the Bile, which ſharpens and whets the Chyle, and qualifies it for unlocking the Body of the nutritious and fat Juices; the vehemence of diſſolving Heat; and the Cauſtic penetrating ſharpneſs of the febrile ferment. The remote cauſes are, the epidemical Conſtitutions of the Air; the immoderat uſe of Brandy, or ſpiritous Liquors, which over-whet the oily volatil Salt of the Choler; the over-frequent ſmoaking of Tobacco, and drinking cold Water after a violent heat. The Scurvy and Cancer in the Breaſts are oft-times liſted into the number of the Cauſes. Theſe melting Feavers ought to be heedfully diſtinguiſh'd from that profluence of Sweat which proceeds from the deficiency of the Spirits, the unbending of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres, and flagging of the looſer parts, as in ſwoonings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Some continual burning Feavers are call'd <hi>Delirious,</hi> when the Spirits move irregularly in the Brain, cauſing doating, inſuſterable Head-aches, ſtubborn watching, and ſometimes Convulſions. The cauſe is partly the heat of the Brain and Spirits, occaſion'd by the violent fermentations of the Blood; and partly the malignity of the febrile ferment, which debauches the quality of the Spirits, and galls the membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous nervous parts.</p>
                        <p>If the malignant ferment break out in Puſhes and Whelks in the Face, Mouth or Head, the Feaver is call'd <hi>Pemphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godes.</hi> If the Perſon ſweat copiouſly the firſt day of the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers invaſion, but without any eaſe or benefit, 'tis call'd <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodes.</hi> If the Perſon be diſquieted, and toſs in Bed, 'tis call'd <hi>Aſſodes.</hi> This laſt ſymptom may be caus'd by weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, notable malignity, vehement heat, impetuoſity of the Spirits, and eſpecially by vicious Humours diſturbing the mouth of the Stomac. If the Perſon be moleſted with a Hiccough, which always proceeds from the Stomac, 'tis call'd <hi>Lyngodes.</hi> If ſhivering and ſhaking attend the whole progreſs of the Feaver, as it oft-times does in the ſuppurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of internal Ulcers, and compound continual Feavers, 'tis call'd <hi>Phricodes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Of all the compound continual, or continual periodical Feavers, that call'd <hi>Semitertiana,</hi> is moſt worthy our regard.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:207638:118"/>'Tis generally look'd upon to be compos'd of a <hi>Tertian</hi> and <hi>Quotidian,</hi> one of which is a Compound Continual, and the other an intermitting Feaver. Authors give ſeveral varying accounts of the periods of this Feaver; but however 'tis fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> the moſt part caſt into this form; <hi>viz.</hi> A Continual Feaver ſeizes the Patient, and periodical ſhiverings follow'd by a notable heat Obſerve the order of a <hi>Tertian,</hi> and gentle ſhiverings ſucceeded by a meeker heat follow a <hi>Quotidian</hi> period.</p>
                        <p>The ſigns of Acute Feavers are manifeſt. A notable Heat and Thirſt always attends a burning Feaver. 'Tis uſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er'd in by a wearineſs of the Body, and perturbation of the Head for ſome days; then by a chilneſs and ſhivering, which intimats, that the volatil oily Particles have not yet obtain'd the aſcendant over the Acid. Afterwards a notable heat ſucceeds; the Pulſe is frequent and accelerated, and if the Salts of the Blood are equally match'd, 'tis large and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual; if it be ſmall or unequal, it beſpeaks malignity. If the Salts of the Blood are very ſharp and exalted, a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vehement heat moleſts the whole Body; if they are temperat, the heat is milder. The Urine, at firſt, is thick, red, and dark; in progreſs of time it diſcovers a Cloud on the top, and, upon the Criſis, a copious ſediment at bottom. If at the height of the Diſeaſe the Urin be thin, 'tis a fatal ſign. If at firſt it appear thick and dark, and afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into a thin conſiſtence, it portends unquietneſs, doat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and frequently Death. But for making a due eſtimat of the Urine, we ought to have a particular regard to the Conſtitution of the Patient. For the Urine of thoſe whoſe Blood is copiouſly temper'd with lymph and nutritious juice, is never ſo high tinctur'd nor ſo thin; as that of Bilious, ſcorburic, or Phthiſical Perſons. Nor can thoſe who ſweat much void ſuch large quantities of Urin and ſediment as others. The Spittle is glutinous and ſcanty, attended by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable thirſt, watchings, Head-aches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Acute Feavers come regularly to a <hi>Criſis</hi> in hot Climats; but in theſe Countries, where we are wont to anticipate Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by alterative, Diaphoretic, and abſorbent Medicins, they are not quite ſo regular. Sometimes they ſpend themſelves by gradual ſolutions by Urine, Night-Sweats, or Salivation.</p>
                        <p>As for the Prognoſtics of acute Feavers: a ſudden unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable Lightning or eaſe is a mortal ſign. If the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms are extream high, the Breaſt diſturb'd, and the Stomac
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:207638:118"/>queaſy, or moleſted with a gnawing Pain; if in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Diſeaſe a looſeneſs happen, attended by a notable proſtration of ſtrength, and a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> corruption of the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; in a word, if any ſigns of malignity appear, 'tis a dangerous caſe. Vomiting is a good ſign. If the Patient be ſomewhat benefited and not overweaken'd by a looſeneſs, 'tis not ſo very dangerous. Sometimes a melting Sweat, in which red Sand-like matter is voided, and found in the Bed, may perform the Cure. White, Pale, crude Urine is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a bad Omen. The more reddiſh it appears at firſt, the ſooner the Diſeaſe comes to its height. The Feavers that are occaſioned by evident cauſes are more favourable, than thoſe whoſe cauſe is inviſible. If ſtrength decay apace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any notable Evacuation, Death is at hand. If the Tongue be moiſt and of a natural red Colour, all is well; but if it be rough, Dry, Black, Livid, Slimy, or Chop'd, 'tis in a bad Condition. The ſwelling of the Face beſpeaks the length of the Diſeaſe. If the ſigns of Concoction appear the fourth Day, the Feaver diſappears the ſeventh, if they are put off till the ſeventh, the eleventh Concludes the matter.</p>

The Bleeding at Noſe is for the moſt part preceded by a tingling of the Ears. If this Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis be imperfect, or diſturb'd by an indiſcreet uſe of abſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent fixing Medicines, 'tis follow'd by inſufferable pains of the Stomac, Guts, or Joints, and ſometimes Palſies.</p>
                        <p>If a Phyſician know how to anticipat the Criſis, by eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuating the morbific matter betimes, and curbing the imperu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Motion, he ought to do it. But in many caſes we are at a loſs how to compaſs it, and therefore are oblig'd to trace Nature's ſteps, and patiently wait her Critical Hour, eſpecially in Benign Feavers, where Nature indeavours to throw out the offenſive particles and purify the Blood. Now to thwart her in ſo good a Work is dangerous. So that all that a Phyſician can do, is to keep Nature upon its Legs, and moderat its efforts. This indication is anſwer'd by cleanſing the firſt Paſſages; tempering the urinous ſharp Salt in the Blood; aſſiſting Nature in its deſign'd Evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:207638:119"/>and mitigating the occaſional Symptoms. Now in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to a happy attainment of theſe ends, 'twill be needful to ſubjoyn the following Remarks.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. That a malignant Feaver in the beginning imitats the Symptoms of a <hi>Cauſus;</hi> and therefore the ſafeſt way is to commence the Cure of the ſame by Alexipharmacal Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, and after the fear of the latent Malignity is over to return to the uſual method of Cure.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. That theſe Alexipharmacal Medicines ought to be mix'd with precipitating Ingredients, as in the Bezoardic Tincture, in order to promote a gentle tranſpiration; but we muſt not by any means attempt to force ſweating.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. That if the ſick Perſons be thirſty and hot, we muſt not deny 'em drink; only let it be warm and all of one ſort, and rather drunk of frequently, than much of it taken down at once, for fear of weakning the Stomac. If the thirſt be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and the Patient free of a looſeneſs, clarify'd Whey with Juice of Citrons is a proper Liquor. Barly Water is commonly given, but I do not approve of it, for that it feeds windy Crudities in the Stomac. Spirit of Sulphur drop'd into Water is very good; as likewiſe Water mix'd with a ſixth part of Wine, and Juice of Citrons or Quinces, and Gelly of Harts-horn.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. In the beginning and progreſs of the Diſeaſe, if the Breaſt and Belly be oppreſs'd, the Body coſtive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Vomits are proper in the beginning; and if the ſtrength of the Patient admit, in the progreſs of the Diſeaſe, They Mitigat all the Symptoms, which are oft-times caus'd or at leaſt heighten'd by the vicious humors lodg'd in the firſt Paſſages. They muſt be given in moderat Doſes, by reaſon that the humors are floating and movable in continual acute Feavers, tho' in the intermitting ſort they are extream fix'd: If the Patient was in the beginning moleſted with a propenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Vomit, or a Squeamiſhneſs, a bitter taſt in the Mouth, or bitter Belchings, Heart-burnings, anxieties of the Breaſt, Swooning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Vomiting is highly Convenient.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. Purgatives properly ſo call'd are prejudicial in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Feavers, except in the Declination, when the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brile matter is not totally evacuated by Urine and Stool. 'Tis true in Benign Feavers we ought to keep the Body ſoluble,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:207638:119"/>and free the Stomac from the overflowing Choler by mild Lenitives. But proper Purgatives exhibited before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of the matter are doubtleſs very offenſive. For if they do not operat they occaſion Gripes, ſwimmings of the Head, Swoonings, and an infinity of diſorders in the Body without any evacuation; if they happen to work well, they infeeble the Body, melt down the humors, and prolong the Diſeaſe. The Decoction of Tamarinds in Whey is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and ſafe Laxative, or, if in the beginning you deſire to cleanſe the firſt Paſſages, take what follows.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Pulp of Tamarinds, a dram; Powder of Rhubarb, a ſcruple; prepar'd Scammony two or three Grains. Make a Bolus. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of choice Rhubarb, a dram and a half; pick'd Senna Leaves, a dram; infuſe them in Whey all Night, in the Morning let them Boyl gently, and add to the ſtrain'd Liquor, two drams of Solutive Syrup of Roſes.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. If the Pulſe be large and ſtrong, if the conſtitution of the Patient be Plethoric and full, if the Blood boyl high, or any notable ſuppreſſion went before, 'tis neceſſary to Bleed in the Beginning of the Feaver, without any regard to Morning or Evening, or any ſet time. After the third or fourth Day 'tis too late. If the Feaver remit, let the Blood be drawn forth during the time of the Remiſſion; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Adminiſtration of a Vomit. Some are wont, in a <hi>Prunella,</hi> to open a vein under the Tongue; and if the Blood run briskly, 'tis accounted a good ſign; if it only ſqueez out by drops, 'tis Ominous. But if theſe foregoing Symptoms be not viſible, let Blood-letting be quite omitted, and a Vomit ſupply its room. Frequent experience teaches us that repeated Blood-letting exalts the Feaver, eſpecially in theſe Northern Climats, and renders Men liable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſes. The Feaver it ſelf exhauſts and dries up the Blood in the Veins, according to <hi>Spigelius</hi> and <hi>Argenterius</hi>'s obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations; upon which account we ought to be very cautious in leſſening its quantity.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. We ought to encourage a breathing Sweat during the whole courſe of the Diſeaſe, by exhibiting the Salts of Wormwood, <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> &amp;c. Coral, ſeal'd Earth, Mineral Bezoar, Harts-horn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which, we may add precipitating Ingredients, in order to correct the febrile Ferment. But all Sulphureous Volatil Roſinous things ought to be carefully avoided; and before the height of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe all forc'd Sweats are improper.</p>
                        <p n="9">
                           <pb n="238" facs="tcp:207638:120"/>IX. Meat or Food muſt never be forc'd upon feaveriſh Perſons; or if their Appetit require any, let it be very thin and watry. Above all, in the declination, take care of eating Meat or cramming the Stomac, while the Digeſtive faculty is yet weak.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. In the beginning or height of a Feaver opiats are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper. In the increaſe, while the Spirits rage, and ſtrength is not quite exhauſted, they are of uſe for pacifying the Spirits, preventing their Conſumption, and promoting the Concoction of the matter. Let 'em be always mix'd with proper ſpecifics.</p>
                        <p>From theſe obſervations we may infer that the alterative ſpecifics are ſuch as either reſpect the Feaver it ſelf and its material Cauſe, or the Symptoms that attend it. Of the former ſort are Nitre, <hi>Arcanum Duplicatum,</hi> and the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs of Minerals fix'd by Nitre, <hi>Diaphoretic Antimony,</hi> Mineral Bezoar, Cinnabar of Antimony, Chalybeat Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bezoar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Cooling and aperient Herbs, as Cichory, Dandelion, Borrage, Bugloſs, Fumitory, Lettuce, Sorrel, Purſlain, Roſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Temperat Oily Seeds, Emulſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Harts-horn, Coral, ſeal'd Earth, Ivory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which we may add Alexipharmacal Medicines, Volatil Salts of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals, as of Harts-horn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of the latter ſort are the Vegetable and Mineral Acid Spirits, eſpecially the laſt, of which the Spirit of Sulphur and Nitre are the beſt; but they ought to be dulcify'd by Spirit of Wine, for temperat things are moſt agreeable to Nature. Spirit of Vitriol contains in it ſome metallin Parts, that are very offenſive. In the vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Province, the clarify'd Juices of Acid Fruits are very proper, and much preferable to the Syrpus, ſuch are the Juices of Citrons, of Quinces, of Barberries, of red Corants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Juices of Houſe-leek, Purſlain, Plantain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe very uſeful. Tamarinds are much approv'd by reaſon of their Laxative and Cooling quality.</p>
                        <p>As for the forms of Receipts, preſcribe as follows. If there be any ſuſpicion of a latent malignity, let forty or ſixty drops of the Bezoardic Tincture be exhibited in the beginning of the Diſeaſe. Then,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Decoction of Harts-horn, with the roots of Vipers-graſs, a pound; freſh juice of Citrons, two ounces; Syrup of Water Lilly-flowers, Syrup of white Poppies, of each ſix drams; dulcify'd Spirit of Nitre, as much as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth for a grateful Acidity. Make a Julep. Or,</p>
                        <pb n="239" facs="tcp:207638:120"/>
                        <p>Take of the Decoction of Harts-horn, with the roots of Vipers-graſs, one Pound; Juice of Barberries, Juice of red Corans, of each an ounce and a half; Tincture of Roſes, Tincture of Violets, of each a dram; Syrup of the Juice of Citrons, an ounce and a half; Spirit of Sulphur as much as ſufficeth for a grateful Acidity. Mix for a Julep. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of Common Water a Convenient Quantity, with a little Wine and as much of the Juice of Quinces as ſufficeth for a grateful Acidity. Mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Take of Borrage Water, Bugloſs Water, and Water of Rasberries, of each an ounce; Cinnamom Water, three drams; freſh Juice of Citrons, ſix or eight drams; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection Alkermes, a dram and a half; Syrup of Rasberries, half an ounce. Mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Take of the Conſerves of Wood-ſorrel, of the Pulp of Citrons, and of Clove Gilly-flowers, of each an ounce; Rob of red Corants, ſix drams; Confection Alkermes, two drams; with a ſufficient quantity of the Syrup of Rasber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Make an Electuary.</p>
                        <p>The Decoction of the Roots and Leaves of Wood-ſorrel mix'd with the Juice of red Corants, and Syrup of Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries, is a very palatable Liquor for quenching Thirſt.</p>
                        <p>Extemporary Tinctures may be drawn from the Flowers of Dazies, Poppies, Roſes, Clove Gillyflowers, Violets, Golum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with common Water, or the Decoction of Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn and Vipers-graſs, or red Poppy Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Flowers being firſt ſprinkl'd with Spirit of Sulphur, or of Vitriol Theſe Tinctures are of a pleaſant red Colour, for all blue Flowers when mix'd with an Acid Spirit, yield a rutilant Tincture.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Tinctures may be ſweeten'd with Syrup of Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries or of Violets, or of Iujubes: and are ſometimes joyn'd to the dulcify'd Acid Spirits, and drop'd into the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent's ordinary Drink.</p>
                        <p>Inſtead of Juleps or Tinctures, ſome uſe the Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Tamarinds; as, take of the Pulp of Tanmarinds, from two to three ounces; Boyl them in a ſufficient quantity of Whey. To two pound of the ſtrain'd Liquor, add Juice of Citrons, ſix or eight drams. Tincture of Dazy Flowers, three drams; Syrup of the Juice of Citrons, an ounce and a half. Mix and Exhibit for ordinary Drinking.</p>
                        <p>Whey is an admirable Drink for Feaveriſh Perſons, if pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify'd by Juice of Citrons, or Pulp of Tamarinds. As, Take of Whey, two pound; freſh Juice of Citrons, three
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:207638:121"/>drams; Flowers of Dazies, and of red Poppies of each a handful and a half. Let 'em boyl in a cloſe Veſſel, till the Whey be impregnated with the Tincture. Strain the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and ſweeten it with Syrup of Poppies, or of Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries.</p>
                        <p>Next to the foregoing Medicines is Nitre, which is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally approv'd by all Practitioners; the preparation of it with Sulphur, call'd <hi>Sal-Prunellae,</hi> is of no efficacy; but if the Crude Nitre be purified by ſome ſharp Lye, it proves an admirable Remedy. <hi>Nitrum Antimoniatum,</hi> which is a complication of Nitre with the Sulphur of Antimony, may be given to a dram in their ordinary Drink, three or four times a Day, or in Powder together with Antihecticum <hi>Poterii.</hi> Diaphoretic Antimony, Mineral Bezoar, or that call'd <hi>Joviale,</hi> or <hi>Saturninum,</hi> together with Harts-horn prepar'd without fire, and the above mention'd abſorbent Earths, are all proper for mitigating the fermentation, and promoting a gentle breathing Heat. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of Rasberry Water, two ounces; Water of Vipers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graſs, and freſh Juice of Quinces, of each an ounce; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoardicum Joviale, a ſcruple; Syrup of white Poppies, an ounce; dulcify'd Spirit of Nitre as much as ſufficeth. Take a ſpoonful now and then.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Water of the Flowers of the Sloe-tree, Water of Elder-Flowers, and Dandelion Water, of each an ounce; Gelly of Harts-horn, an ounce and a half; Harts-horn prepar'd without fire, a ſcruple; <hi>Poterius</hi>'s <hi>Antihectic,</hi> and Diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retic Antimony, of each twelve grains; Syrup of Poppies ſix drams. Mix and uſe as above.</p>
                        <p>In a Solid form they are preſcrib'd thus. Take of purify'd Nitre, ſixteen grains, <hi>Poterius Antihectic</hi> Powder, half a ſcruple; Sugar of Lead five grains. If a Delirium be fear'd, or Malignity ſuſpected, add a grain or two of Camphyr.</p>
                        <p>Take of Nitrum Antimoniatum, two ſcruples; Chaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat Diaphoretic Antimony, half a dram; <hi>Laudanum Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atum,</hi> a grain or two. Mix for two Doſes, to betaken at Night in a convenient Vehicle.</p>
                        <p>Depurated Nitre or Nitrum Antimoniatum, may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd in their ordinary Drink, after the rate of half an ounce in twenty four Hours.</p>
                        <p>Emulſions are next in order. They are very proper for tempering the Bilious Salt, and qualifying the acrimony of the Blood. But they ought not to be too frequently or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:207638:121"/>us'd; for that they weaken the Stomac, and clog the Appetit. Let 'em be mix'd with fix'd Powders. Thus,</p>
                        <p>Take of ſweet Almonds, two drams; Seeds of white Poppies, a dram; of the four cold Seeds, of each a dram; with Water of Wood-ſorrel, make an Emulſion: To which add, Diaphoretic Antimony, and Mineral Bezoar, of each half a dram. Sweeten it with pearl'd Sugar, and exhibit a ſpoonful now and then.</p>
                        <p>So much for Internal Remedies. Externally ſome are wont to apply Cataplaſms to the Palms of the Hands and ſoles of the Feet; as in the caſe of Watchings, <hi>Deliriums</hi> Pains <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Take of freſh Rue Leaves, two or three hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls; Radiſh Roots ſlic'd, in number two or three; Salt, a handful; of the ſtrongeſt Yeſt, two ounces with Rue Vinegar, make a Cataplaſm to be applied as above.</p>
                        <p>The Juice of River Crabs may be applied in like manner, or by way of <hi>Epithema</hi> to the fore-head. When the Mouth and Head are much affected, 'tis not improper to open the Vein under the Tongue, or the Vein in the Fore-head, or to apply Leeches behind the Ears. The application of convenient Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quids to the Fore-head and Temples is alſo not improper. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Water of Dill, or of Roſes, or of Elder Flowers, or of Vervain, two ounces; Apoplectic Water, half an ounce; <hi>Philonium Romanum,</hi> or <hi>Requi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Make an Emulſion. To which add ſix or ſeven grains of Camphyr; and the Juice of River Crabs. Mix for an Epitheme to be us'd as above. In <hi>Deliriums,</hi> Camphyr is a ſovereign Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but in the caſe of watchful Slumbers it ought to be cautiouſly us'd.</p>
                        <p>Take of Betony Water, Elder Flower Water, and the Water of red Poppy Flowers, of each an ounce expreſs'd Juice of River Crabs, three ounces; Spirit of Wine cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoris'd, three drams. Mix for the above mentioned uſe.</p>

As,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Leaves of Self-heal, Willows, and Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries, Barley not bruis'd, of each a handful. Boyl them in Water, and add to a pound of the ſtrain'd Liquor one ounce of the Syrup of Mulberries, and half a dram of <hi>Nitrum Antimoniatum.</hi> Mix for a Gargle. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take ſix River Crabs, bruiſe 'em with Rasberry Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and expreſs the Juice; to which add Juice of Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leek, three ounces; Rob of Nuts, one ounce; <hi>Nitrum An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timoniatum,</hi> a dram. Mix and anoint the Tongue. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of Houſe-leek Water, a pound and a half; Juice of River Crabs four ounces; <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi> purify'd, a dram and a half. Mix, and make a warm Gargle. <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi> and Nitre are noted Ingredients in all Gargles of this Nature. Water, Spirit of Wine, and Hony, are very uſeful for the ſame purpoſe, in malignant Feavers, attended by a roughneſs and Dryneſs of the Palat, without any ſlimy Cruſt. Freſh Lard, or Butter, or Juice of Rapes boyl'd to a Syrup, are likewiſe very proper to be laid on the Tongue in ſuch an extremity.</p>
                        <p>In continual periodical Feavers, regard muſt be had to the Paroxyſms, by exhibiting before the hour of their Invaſion fix'd Antimonial Powders, Coral, Crabs Eyes, Vitriolated Nitre, Salt of <hi>Carduus Benedictus, Poterius</hi>'s <hi>Antihectic,</hi> and forming Compoſitions of the Acid and Earthy Ingredients, and varying them according as the Symtoms require.</p>
                        <p>Semitertian Feavers ought to be treated in the ſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod; only we muſt remember to vary it according as the Symptoms are ſlow or acute, favourable or malign. If they are attended by Inflammations of particular parts, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch as are very ſenſible, and of the nobler Character, let
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:207638:122"/>theſe be carefully accounted for. Abſorbent <hi>Alcali</hi>'s are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for vanquiſhing the Shivering and Shaking; Vomits are convenient in all Caſes; prevailing heat is abated by ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines as render the Body ſoluble, and promote a breathing Sweat; Inflammatious are appeas'd by Diaphoretics: And when the Feaver moves ſlowly, cleanſing and attenuating Salts, ſuch as <hi>Sal-armoniac, Arcanum Duplicatum,</hi> &amp;c. are of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar uſe.</p>
                        <p>In a Cauſus, or burning Feaver, Nitre diſſolv'd in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Drink, and <hi>Laudanum Opiatum</hi> cautiouſly adminiſtred, effectually abate the violence of Heat.</p>

                        <p>IF the Lymph of the Glandules, ſeated about the Head and Breaſt, become ſharp and ſaline, it creates a notable alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Blood and Spirits, a biting ſharp Heat, tho' not over vehement or intenſe, and a ſenſe of ſhooting Pains, Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs, and as it were Contuſions of the Joynts; and being plentifully caſt forth about the Brain and Neck occaſions a weighty drouſie Head-ach, Defluxions into the Mouth and Lungs, a Hoarſeneſs, and Cough; the uſual Symptoms of a Feaveriſh Catarrh.</p>
                        <p>This Feaver ſeems to be near ally'd to the continual Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidian Periodical Feavers of the Antients. In the Evening, when the Quantity of vicious Lymph is augmented within the Body by the diminution of the inſenſible tranſpiration, the Symptoms, eſpecially the Heat, are heighten'd. About Midnight they begin to relent, and in the Day-time are
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:207638:123"/>ſometimes follow'd by a gentle Shivering. The Pulſe is frequent and ſwift, pretty large and vehement. The Urine is at firſt high Colour'd, but after two or three Days it thickens, becomes muddy and yellowiſh, and depoſius a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Sediment.</p>
                        <p>If this Feaver be Epidemical or Malignant, and proceed from the Contagion of the Air, which ſeldom happens, 'tis dangerous, and terminats in mortal Convulſions.</p>
                        <p>The Indications of Cure divide themſelves into three Branches. 1. To extinguiſh the irritation of the ſolid Parts, which provokes the Spirits, and occaſions the effuſion of the Lymph. 2. To qualifie the peccant Acrimony of the Lymph. 3. When 'tis thus qualify'd to evacuat it by convenient Paſſages. The firſt is accounted for by Opiats; the ſecond by Volatil <hi>Alcalin</hi> Salts, abſorbent temperat and thickening Medicins, as the fix'd preparations of Antimony, <hi>Poterius</hi>'s Antihectic, Flowers of Sulphur, prepar'd Amber, Oyl of Amber, Spirit of Mother of Thyme, Decoction of Saſſafras, Myrrh, Camphyr, volatil Salt of Harts-horn, Spirit and volatil Salt of Human Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The third De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is compaſs'd by diaphoretic, diuretic, and expectora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and, when the Lymph is well concocted, by ſneezing and chewing Medicins.</p>
                        <p>Take of Fennel-Water, and Water of red Poppy-flowers, of each an Ounce and a half; Spirit of Harts-horn im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with Amber, a Dram and a half; Eſſence of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium,</hi> Jaw-bone of a Pike, of each half a Dram; Syrup of the Flowers of red Poppies, half an Ounce, or ſix Drams. Mix them for a Julep, of which, exhibit a ſpoonful every Hour towards Evening.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi> anniſated, or of the Eſſence of Amber, two Drams; Eſſence of <hi>Opium,</hi> half a Dram. Mix 'em, and exhibit forty or fifty drops, ſome Hours before the periodical exaſperation, and reiterate the ſame Doſe at Night.</p>
                        <p>Take of prepar'd Amber, half a Scruple; choice Myrrh, five grains volatil Salt of Amber, four grains; Extract of Saffron, two grains; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> one grain; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd Oyl of Amber, one drop. Mix for a Powder to be exhibited in like manner.</p>
                        <p>If the Lymph be ſaltiſh, Liquorice, Figgs, Jujubes, Barly, emulſions of Poppy-Seeds, Opiats, Pills of Storax, and ſuch like are proper. If hoarſneſs and a difficulty of ſpeech pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, give what follows.</p>
                        <pb n="246" facs="tcp:207638:124"/>
                        <p>Take of Mint-Water, two Ounces; Cinnamon-water, half an Ounce Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi> aniſated, a Dram; <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum Opiatum,</hi> three grains; Syrup of Raiſins, ſix Drams. Mix, and give a ſpoonful now and then.</p>
                        <p>If the Wind-pipe, Gullet, and Throat be excoriated, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of Diacodium, Loh of Raiſins, and licking Medecins are proper. If a dry Cough moleſt the Patient, let thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and pacific Remedies be us'd. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Water of wild Thyme, Water of <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> of each an Ounce; Spirit of Treacle campho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris'd, Eſſence of Saſſafras, of each two Drams; Spirit of Harts-horn ſuccinated, a Dram; Syrup of white Poppies, half an Ounce. Mix them, and adminiſter a ſpoonful fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in the Evening.</p>
                        <p>This method, if inſiſted on, together with the continued uſe of the Decoction of Saſſafras, will in time conquer the Feaver. After the Feaver is abated, and the Spirits reduc'd to order, let the Body be looſen'd by <hi>Queretanus</hi>'s Pills of Ammoniac, or <hi>Crato</hi>'s Pills of Amber. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Crato</hi>'s Pills of Amber, a ſcruple; volatil Salt of Amber, ſix grains; Roſin of Jalap, three grains; extract of <hi>Troches Alhandal,</hi> one grain; diſtill'd Oyl of Amber, two drops: with Eſſence of Saſſafras, make Pills.</p>
                        <p>In order to evacuate the prepar'd Lymph, give forty or fifty drops of the Liquor of <hi>Terra Foliata Tartari,</hi> twice a day, which is a proper Diuretic; or expreſs'd Juice of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhes with Sugar, which attenuats the Phlegm; or the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing expectorating mixture.</p>
                        <p>Take of Hyſſop-water, two Ounces, Aſthmatic-water, half an Ounce; Spirit of purifi'd Gum Ammoniac, two Drams; Syrup of Tobacco, four or ſix Drams; <hi>Sala</hi>'s e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metic Syrup, a dram. Mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the beginning while the Cough is yet dry, temperat thickening Medicins are requir'd, but afterwards when the Cough brings up large quantities of viſcous Matter, let cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting expectorating Remedies be us'd. If the Phlegm be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably tough and thick, let Oyl of Amber be appli'd to the Noſtrils, or let the Perſon ſmell frequently of Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> or that of Urine, or of Harts-horn. In the laſt extremity, let the Powder of black Helebor and white Sugar, with diſtill'd Oyl of Cloves, be thrown into the Noſtrils.</p>
                        <p>If the pain of the Head be violent, anoint the Crown with Oyl of Amber, or Balſam of <hi>Peru,</hi> or apply the Plaiſter of Bettony ſoften'd with Oyl of Amber. After the Diſeaſe is
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:207638:124"/>in good meaſure ſubdu'd, the following Decoction is of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent uſe for purifying the Blood, correcting the ſharpneſs of the Lymph, fortifying the Lungs, and preventing a Phthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic.</p>
                        <p>Take of the ſhavings of red Saunders, one Ounce; ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings of Saſſafras, half an Ounce; ſteep them in ſeven pound of Water, for the ſpace of twelve Hours, then boil them till a pound and a half be conſum'd, and add of the Leaves of Ground Ivy, Leaves of Speed-well, Flowers of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Wort, of each two handfuls; Liquorice Roots half an Ounce; Fennel-Seeds, ſix drams; bruis'd Currans, three Ounces. Boil the Liquor into four Pounds, ſtrain it, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit a large draught warm Morning and Evening.</p>

                        <head>ART. 2. <hi>Of Feavers proceeding from the Lymph of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glomerat Glandules, or ſuch as are roll'd into a heap.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THE conglomerat Glandules depoſit their juice into ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities, from whence 'tis convey'd to the Blood. The chief of 'em are the Sweet-bread, and thoſe behind the Ears. The former waters the Guts, the latter the Mouth. If their Serum be viſcous, or over ſaline, it occaſions a ſlow ſort of a Feaver. All ſlow Feavers are periodical, as being exaſperated either in the Evening, after the method of <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidians,</hi> or after eating, in the form of <hi>Hectic</hi> Feavers.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe which are independent of any other Diſeaſe, are call'd <hi>Primary.</hi> And thoſe which follow the Corruption of any inward part, or the miſmanagement of a preceding Diſeaſe, are ſtil'd <hi>Symptomatical.</hi> Tho' the laſt approach very near to the primary form.</p>
                        <div type="part">
                           <head>Of independent ſlow Feavers.</head>
                           <p>They are uſher'd in by a gentle ſhivering, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues for ſome time, and is follow'd by a mild Heat, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſharper in the extream parts. The Appetit is dejected, and after eating, the Stomach and Guts are diſtended, and oppreſt with a heavy pain. Towards the Evening,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:207638:125"/>or after Meals, they increaſe their force; at which time the Pulſe is frequent, and not very large. If the Spittle be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably viſcous, the Mouth and Throat are cover'd with ſlime, and the Perſon moleſted with Thirſt. If the Juice of the Sweet-bread be likewiſe over viſcid or ſaline, anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty invades the Breaſt and griping ſhooting pains beſet the Belly; the Pulſe is frequent and ſwift, and in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure weak and ſmall. The Urine, at firſt, is high colour'd, afterwards it becomes muddy, and drops a ſediment. The Joints are ſeiz'd with a wearineſs and ſhooting pains, and ſometimes the Head with a dull heavy ache.</p>
                           <p>If the Lymph be ſimply ſaline, the ſymptoms are fiercer; if it be likewiſe viſcid and tough, they are weaker, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue longer. The ſlow Feavers differ from acute ones in this; that the cauſe of the latter is a volatil ſharp Acid, which in the former, is invelop'd with a viſcous tenacious Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle.</p>
                           <p>The Original cauſe is a vicious Digeſtion, rendring the Chyle viſcid, or tending to a ſort of acid ſaline taſte. If the Evening Paroxyſms are long, the Strength and Appetit much impair'd, 'tis a dangerous circumſtance. The moſt favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſort, if not cautiouſly taken care of, terminates in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chexies,</hi> or <hi>Hectic</hi> Feavers.</p>
                           <p>Theſe Feavers are cur'd by retrieving the loſt Digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Stomac; correcting the viſcidity, or ſharpneſs of the Lymph, eſpecially the <hi>ſaliva</hi> and <hi>pancreatic</hi> juice evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating the crude Phlegm, and Lymph thus prepar'd; and mitigating the Symptoms.</p>
                           <p>If the Breaſt be oppreſs'd, let a gentle Vomit be exhibited, or a mild purgative. As,</p>
                           <p>Take <hi>Mynſicht</hi>'s emetic Tartar, two or three grains; puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> eight grains. Or,</p>
                           <p>Take of <hi>Ruffius</hi>'s Pills <hi>de tribus,</hi> fifteen grains; fulmina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Gold, three grains; prepar'd Scammony, <hi>Treches Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handal,</hi> of each a grain. With compound Tincture of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> make Pills.</p>
                           <p>In the next place, attenuating Diuretic Remedies are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as dulcifi'd Spirit of Salt, (of excellent uſe againſt a <hi>Hectic</hi>) dulcifi'd Spirit of Nitre, eſſential Salt of <hi>Tartar, Sal-Armoniac, Nitrum Antimoniatum, Tartar</hi> vitriolated, <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra foliata Tartari,</hi> or its Liquor, Tincture of <hi>Tartar,</hi> Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Myrrh tartaris'd, carminative Spirit, Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi> aniſated, <hi>Poterius</hi>'s Antihectic, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <pb n="249" facs="tcp:207638:125"/>
                           <p>Take of purifi'd <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> half a dram; <hi>Poterius</hi>'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tihectic, a ſcruple; make a Powder for two Doſes, one in the Morning, and the other at Night before the Fit. <hi>Nitrum Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniatum</hi> mix'd with an equal quantity of <hi>Sal-Armoniac;</hi> or <hi>Arcanum duplicatum</hi> mix'd with diaphoretic Antimony; or <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi> mix'd with Galangal and Ginger, are ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully us'd after the ſame method.</p>
                           <p>Take of Mint-Water, and Fennel-Water, of each an ounce and a half; Spirit of Treacle, two or three Drams; dulci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd Spirit of Salt, half a dram, or a whole dram<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                              <hi>Poterius</hi>'s Antihectic, a ſcruple; Syrup of Hyſſop, ſix or eight drams. Mix for two Doſes.</p>
                           <p>Let the Mouth be gargaris'd with ſmall Beer and Hony of Roſes; or with Water, Vinegar, and purifi'd Nitre or the infuſion of Holyhoc-flowers, in Water, with a little Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Salt, and a convenient Syrup.</p>
                           <p>The Feaver call'd <hi>Epiala,</hi> in which the inward parts are oppreſs'd with heat, while the external are cold, is, by ſome, referr'd to this Head. But 'tis only a combination, or ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter of either a <hi>Continual</hi> and <hi>Intermitting,</hi> or two <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting</hi> Feavers.</p>
                           <p>The Swoonings that ſometimes attend both this and other ſorts of Feavers, are caus'd either by ſome viſcious ſlime, irritating the Mouth of the Stomac or ſome ſharp ruſty Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour lodg'd in it. In the laſt caſe, Unicorn's Horn, or the Decoction of Tamarinds in Water, are much approv'd. But if a viſcid windy Matter ariſe to them, volatil ſpiritous Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are proper. Tho', after all, 'tis worthy our conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what <hi>Ballonius</hi> remarks upon this matter; <hi>viz.</hi> That many Phyſicians are faulty in giving ſtrong Cordials againſt ſwooning, where purging were more proper.</p>

                           <p>Theſe Feavers are frequently occaſion'd by a prepoſterous uſe of Abſorbents in <hi>Intermitting</hi> and <hi>Continual</hi> Feavers, which fix the heterogeneous Particles, and render the Chyle and Lymph viſcid; or by over-feeding in the declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of other Feavers while the digeſtive faculty is weak; by which means the Chyle is loaded with Crudities. They may likewiſe follow other Diſeaſes proceeding from a viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous Acid. Their Symptoms are the ſame as above, to which we may add, that ſometimes they are accompanied by a looſeneſs, or voiding of liquid pituitous Matter.</p>
                           <pb n="250" facs="tcp:207638:126"/>
                           <p>The Cure conſiſts in tempering the ſaltiſh Acid, attenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the viſcid Matter, and procuring to it an egreſs by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, ſtool, urine or ſweat. They ſometimes proceed from Ulcers, eſpecially of the internal parts: retention of the After-birth, a dead Child in the Womb, chronical Pains; and are cur'd by removing the reſpective Cauſe by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decins alotted to that purpoſe. In general, gentle Vomits and Purges are proper; and in a word the whole ſeries of Medicins preſcrib'd for the independent <hi>Slow</hi> Feavers.</p>
                           <p>Sometimes ſuch Feavers follow an unſeaſonable uſe of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorific Decoctions againſt the Pox, before the Body be eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated; and are cur'd by vomiting, and the repeated uſe of <hi>Sal-Armoniac.</hi>

                           <p>A <hi>Hectic</hi> is a <hi>Slow</hi> Feaver advancing inſenſibly. If it be a principal independent Diſeaſe it proceeds from the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of undigeſted Food in the Stomac, immoderate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, ſorrow, watchings, want, over-liberal evacuations, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Bathings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oft-times 'tis only a ſymptom of other Diſeaſes, and follows the irregular Cure of <hi>Continual</hi> and <hi>Intermitting</hi> Feavers, Inflamations of the Bowels, Lungs, Meſentery, Womb, and Kidneys; the <hi>French-Pox, &amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Part affected is not the habit of the Body, as the Ancients fancy'd; but the maſs of Blood, and Lymph: Hence the greateſt heat is perceiv'd about the Arteries. As for the independent Principal ſort of <hi>Hectics,</hi> the Stomac and digeſtive Faculty are the original ſeat of their cauſe.</p>
                           <p>The immediat cauſe is the indiſpoſition and unequal texture of the Blood, caus'd by the ſaltiſh ſharpneſs of the Lymph in the conglobat Glandules, and the viſcoſity of that in the Conglomerat. From whence inſue a deprav'd and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd fermentation, weakneſs, wearineſs, deficiency of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and the whole train of <hi>Hectic</hi> Symptoms. The ſalin and viſcid Blood is render'd unfit for nouriſhing the parts; and after eating, when the thin readier part of the freſh Chyle dilutes the Blood, and diſengages its Salts, the Pulſe is a little enlarg'd, and the Heat augmented; and after ſome time, ſink again to their ordinary pitch. And the coarſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of the Chyle, are frequently voided by Night-Sweats, as having receiv'd a vicious Tincture in the Stomac from the <hi>Saliva,</hi> and being, upon that Account, equally diſagreeable to the Blood and ſolid parts.</p>
                           <pb n="251" facs="tcp:207638:126"/>
                           <p>As for the Remote Cauſes. Fatigue and Labour, Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings and Care exhauſt the Spirits, and watery Vehicle of the Blood; Anger exalts the Bilious Salt, which joyning with the Acid, acquires a ſaline Acrimony; Grief and Sorrow increaſe the Acid, which joyning to the urinous Salt, becomes dull and unactive; indigeſted Crudities in the Stomac, or the want of Food, occaſion a ſtricter union between the Acid and urinous Salts, and their mutual degeneracy into a third ſharp ſaline Body; Ulcers, both internal and external, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Blood by vertue of their ſalin ſharp Matter; conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual and intermitting Feavers, attended by plentiful Sweats exhauſt the dewy watry part of the Blood; or the unſeaſonable uſe of abſorbent earthy Powders, adminiſtred for their Cure, deſtroys the Ferment of the Stomac, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes the Acrimony of the Blood. Thus they all conſpire to render the Blood and Lymph ſaltiſh or viſcous.</p>
                           <p>There are three Eſſential Signs of a Hectic Feaver. 1. An obſcure inſenſible Heat, increaſing after eating. 2. The ſucceſſive Conſumption of the Body. 3. A ſwift, frequent, ſmall, weak, and oft-times a hard Pulſe. To which we may add in ſome caſes Night-Sweats, the falling off of the Hairs, an univerſal Wearineſs, inward Heat, and averſeneſs to ſleep in the morning. If Aſhy belchings precede the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of theſe Symptoms, they ſerve for a confirmation. In the beginning of the Diſeaſe the Urine reſembles that of healthy Perſons, unleſs the Stomac be much deprav'd, in which caſe 'tis white, pale, and thick; afterwards when the Appetit and Digeſtion are in a manner quite aboliſh'd it becomes thin, tranſparent and high Colour'd; and when 'tis form'd into a perfect Conſumption, a fat oily Cruſt, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Cobwebs, ſwims on the Top. But we ought carefully to diſtinguiſh between the real fat Cruſt, which is uſual in continual and intermitting Feavers, and proceeds from the exceſſive Heat which melts the internal Fat, and is always uniform as to its Colour and Appearance; and the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Cruſt, familiar to Hypocondriac and Scorbutic Perſons, which is nothing elſe but the concretion of vicious Salts, and when the Chamber-pot is a little inclin'd, appears green, or parti-color'd like a Peacock's Tail. In the beginning of a Hectic the Belly is coſtive; but when 'tis further advanc'd, and the Stomac and Digeſtive faculty quite gone, they are moleſted with a Looſeneſs, which, together with melting Sweats, off-fallings of Hair, and univerſal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of Body, at length finiſhes their Days.</p>
                           <pb n="252" facs="tcp:207638:127"/>
                           <p>A Perfect Hectic Feaver may be conſider'd in its ſeveral degrees. 1. When the Nutritious Juice is diſpers'd, and miſ-apply'd. 2. When not only the ſimple Nutritious Juice, but the fat, and what was already appropriated to particular ſolid parts, is melted down and conſum'd. 3. When be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe Symptoms the Fibres of the ſolid parts are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly dry and wither'd.</p>
                           <p>The laſt degree is incurable. If a Hectic be occaſion'd by diſorders of the Bowels, or internal Ulcers; if it follow continual or intermitting Feavers or chronical Diſtempers; if the Hairs fall off, and the Perſon be old, or moleſted with a Looſeneſs, or <hi>Lienteria,</hi> attended by a ghaſtly Countenance, and ſwellings of the Feet and Legs; they are all fatal Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, eſpecially the laſt three.</p>
                           <p>If it be a principal independent uncompounded Hectic, the direct Indications of Cure are, to temper the Acrimony of the Blood, and Acid Viſcoſity of the Lymph; and to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborat the Stomac For which purpoſes obſerve. 1. That Bleeding, Purging, or any Evacuations are improper; unleſs the firſt Paſſages be ſtull'd with Crudities, for which a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Laxative is allowable, but in a ſmall Doſe; by reaſon that Hectic Perſons are very eaſily Purg'd. 2. If it ariſe from the Stomac, as it frequently do's, Vomits, and the uſe of <hi>Elixir Proprietatis</hi> are very effectual. 3. That by all means Looſeneſſes and exceſſive Sweats muſt be curb'd; the former by Quinces, red Roſes, Chalybeat Milk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The latter by Opiats given at Night in ſmall Doſes. 4. That all ſweet things, Sugar, Hony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ought to be cautiouſly avoided, by reaſon that they are offenſive to the Stomac, and impart a viſcidity to the humors of the Body.</p>
                           <p>If the Feaver be Simptomatical, a particular regard muſt be had to the principal Diſeaſe, and above all to the Stomac. If it follow a continual or intermitting Feaver, a Vomit, if convenient, may be adminiſtred, and after that there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better than <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> and <hi>Poterius</hi>'s Antihectic.</p>
                           <p>If it follow an Ulcer of any internal Part, vulnerary Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Medicines are proper, eſpecially the Balſam of Sulphur prepar'd with expreſs'd Oyl of Almonds (diſtill'd Oyls are too ſharp) or, this Balſam thus prepar'd may be mix'd with a little Oyl of Aniſeeds. Turpentin diſſolv'd in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>olk of an Egg, or human Fat, or the Decoctions of vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerary or pectoral Herbs, are likewiſe proper.</p>
                           <p>After the principal Diſeaſes, and the ſtate of the Stomac are taken care of, the Hectic Feaver it ſelf muſt be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:207638:127"/>for, by exhibiting temperat attenuating Medicines. The eſſential Salt of May-dew, or its Spirit, with the Flowers of Violets, Borrage, and Bugloſs infus'd in it; the Phlegm of Vitriol that comes over before the Spirit, if it be rectify'd, the Juice or Dew which ſticks to the Herb call'd Roſaſolis; the Juicy fat Herbs, Fruits, and Seeds, ſuch as, Houſe-leek, Plantan, Succory, Marſhmallows, Lettuce, Purſlain, Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, Bugloſs, Fiſtic Nuts, ſweet Almonds, Sebeſtins, the four cold Seeds, white Poppy Seeds, and eſpecially Currans or Raiſins whether by way of Pulp, or Decoction with Saſſafras, China and Elecampane Roots; or Fermentation with Wine, or Preparation with Juice of Apples; are all noted Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifics for this purpoſe. Crabs Eyes and Pearls are ſovereign Antihectics, if we could reſolve 'em into their primitive milky Liquor from whence they ſprung. <hi>Terra foliata Tartari,</hi> and its Liquor well prepar'd, is likewiſe of good uſe. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tihecticum Poterii</hi> is a noble Medicine, if it be very well ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Sulphur of the Tin. As thus,</p>
                           <p>Take five parts of purify'd Tin, and four parts of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus of Antimony. Melt and fix them with triple the Quantity of Nitre. While the mixture ſtands melted, ſtir it with a wooden Spatula, that by ſo doing the Sulphur of the Tin may evaporat. Afterwards diſſolve the mixture, and reſerve for uſe the white Powder that ſinks to the Bottom.</p>
                           <p>Diaphoretic Antimony, mineral Bezoar, Ivory, Coral, mix'd <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> or <hi>Arcanum Duplicatum,</hi> or with <hi>Myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicht's</hi> Magiſtery of Lead, or Sugar of Lead, are very conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, where the Heat is more intenſe. Some give thirty drops of the Antiphthifical Tincture prepar'd from Sugar of Lead, and Vitriol of Steel. Allum, or its Spirit, mix'd with Spirit of Wine, is much applauded. Spirit and Oyl of human Blood are recommended by Mr. <hi>Boyle.</hi> If Grief or any paſſion of the Mind threaten a Hectic, give twice a Day forty drops of the Tincture of Coral with Spirit of Stags-heart.</p>
                           <p>Some receive great Benefit by a Milk Diet of Womens, Aſſes, Goats, and Cows Milk. But it ought to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencd before the ſtrength is very much impair'd, or the Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion loſt. In a word, 'twill be proper to mind theſe Cautions. 1. That the Hectic be not attended by a putrid Feaver, or a Head-ach, or diſtention of the Hypochondria, or a foul Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac, and weak Digeſtion. 2. That while Perſons uſe Milk they Eat or Drink little elſe. 3. That all Acids be avoided, and a little Sugar added to the Milk, to prevent its Curd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:207638:128"/>4. That the Milk be taken warm, and with a faſting Stomac, either by ſucking it from the Breaſts, or drinking it when juſt milk'd, for fear of any Alteration from the Air. 5. That the Phyſician ought to try firſt if the Milk Diet agree with the Patient's Conſtitution; as after a gentle Purgation let him exhibit three or four ounces of Milk, and if there inſue no ſenſe of weight about the Stomac, Hiccough, Squea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhneſs, increaſe of Heat, or acceleration of the Pulſe, he may exhibit a Pint every Morning and Evening. And after drinking of it, the Patient muſt not ſleep or uſe violent Motion</p>
                           <p>The Food of <hi>Hectic</hi> Perſons muſt be temperat and juicy; as Broth, decoctions of Rice or Barley, Pullets, Capons, Hens, Ducks fed with Frogs and Cocles, Snails fed with Sugar and Meal, and boil'd in Hen-broth; juice of River-Crabs made up with Butter, or mixt with the Oil or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of ſweet Almonds; Oyſters, if the Stomach be able to digeſt 'em, and the Appetit covet 'em; Eels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But under a Milk Diet, let the Patient abſtain from Meat.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>A Feaver is call'd <hi>Malignant,</hi> when 'tis attended by more diſmal Symptoms, than its viſible Cauſe is wont to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. Malignity is not inſeparably united to Contagion, there being ſome contagious Diſeaſes that are not malignant, as the <hi>Itch,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>e contra.</hi> Oft-times it lies latent in the Body for three or four days, 'till the Seaſon of exhibiting Antidotes be over; upon which account, a Phyſician ought to be very watchful in the Beginnings of Feavers.</p>
                     <p>The Symptoms which lead us to the diſcovery of a latent Malignity, are theſe following; a ſudden proſtration of ſtrength, and the Appetit dejected, while the other Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are regularly perform'd, ſtubborn Watchings with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any anxiety if the Head be only affected; but if the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:207638:128"/>Stomac and Breaſt be diſorder'd, they are attended with a great perplexity, toſſing to and again, ſometimes the whole Body, ſometimes only an Arm or a Leg; to which ſymptom Deliriums and Convulſions frequently ſucceed. The Urine reſembles that of healthy Perſons; or, if by vertue of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, or otherwiſe, it happens to thicken, yet it ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues tranſparent, and has little or no ſediment, unleſs it be a yellowiſh Clot of Chyle voided along with it. The Pulſe is at firſt in ſeeming good order, of a ſudden it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes weak, ſmall, oft-times hard; and towards the height of the Feaver, unequal. At firſt a gentle ſhivering may uſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the Feaver; to which ſucceeds a very moderat heat externally, tho' in the mean while they are burnt up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which is a fatal ſign of internal Inflammations. And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the moderation of the Heat, an unquenchable thirſt moleſts 'em, and their Tongue is dry and rough. Or if on the contrary, they be extream hot, and withal inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of thirſt, 'tis likewiſe a ſign of malignity. Theſe are the moſt common Symptoms. Sometimes the Feaver is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by violent Head-aches; difficult reſpiration, reſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon the point of cuticular Eruptions; ſtinking Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, and laſtly, eruptions of Spotts, Puſhes, Wheals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> According to which it undergoes ſeveral Denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Sometimes the malignity is arriv'd at that height, that the external Parts are corrupted and ſeiz'd with <hi>Gangreens,</hi> the Perſon poſſeſs'd with, an invincible averſion to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Liquors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Malignant Feavers admit of ſeveral Degrees. The firſt is when the occaſional ſharpneſs and degeneracy of the febril ferment, converts a benign Feaver into a malign one. 2. When the ferment is not only ſharp, but contagious, or epidemical. Now the original of Contagion, is an active ſpirituous ferment, eaſily communicable to the Spirits, and capable to propagate it ſelf by a fermentative motion, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fit for its purpoſe; which, in company of Spirits ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hal'd from the ſick Perſon, pitch upon thoſe whoſe Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and Pores gives the eaſieſt admiſſion, ſuch as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the ſick Perſon, weak People, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> The manner of its reaching and inſinuating into ſuch Perſons, is either by immediat Contact, or in the Vehicle of Food, Cloaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or that of the Air convey'd into the Lungs, where it debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches the Spirits circulating that way, and in paſſing the Mouth, adulterats the Saliva, which immediately affects the moſt ſenſible Orifice of the Stomac: Hence the firſt,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:207638:129"/>and moſt diſmal Scene of tragical Symptoms is laid in the Stomac. 3. When the ferment is become peſtilent. And, 4. When 'tis form'd into a direct Plague.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe of Malignity, aſſign'd by <hi>Willis,</hi> is the coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood; and that by <hi>Sylvius,</hi> is a ſharp volatil lixivious Alcali, deſtroying the acid Sulphur of the Blood, and conſequently, its conſiſtence: But the vicious fluidity of the Blood attending malignity confutes the former; and the natural inactivity of <hi>Alcali</hi>'s, the known power of vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Acids in extinguiſhing the animal Spitits, and galling the nervous Syſtem; and the Antidotal vertue of <hi>Alcali</hi>'s, both volatil and fix'd, ſuch as Camphyr, Myrrh, and the abſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent Powders, overturns the latter Hypotheſis. 'Tis there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a ſharp volatil <hi>Acid</hi> that cauſes malignity, partly by diſſolving the texture of the Blood, and diſpoſing it for Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction, and generation of Worms, obſervable by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſcopes; partly by irritating the Stomac, Brain, and ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Parts, and partly by extinguiſhing both the vital and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal Spirits.</p>
                     <p>That the Spirits are immediatly attack'd as well as the Blood and Humors, is made to appear by the ſymptoms of ſudden Weakneſs, contracted Pulſes, Watchings, Deliriums, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by the force of imagination in propagating the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion. Nay oft-times the Spirits are principally aſſaulted, and the Humors only mediatly, thro' their ſides. Now it will be of uſe in malignant Feavers, to diſtinguiſh nicely the original trouble of the Animal Spirits and nervous Syſtem, from that of the vital Spirits and Maſs of Blood. The Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the former, are an unquenchable Thirſt, a rough and dry Tongue, a quick and ſmall Pulſe, attended by a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat Heat, anxiety and unquietneſs (proceeding from the Stomac) a melting looſeneſs, the rotten ſmell of Excrements, and the thin fluid conſiſtence of the Blood: Thoſe of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are a violent heat of the Forehead; the hardneſs of the Pulſe, without the trouble of any membrane in the Body; or a laudable Pulſe attended by extream weakneſs; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Appetit, ſqueamiſhneſs, vomiting, ſtubborn watchings without any viſible Cauſe, the dryneſs or roughneſs of the Skin, and the unaccountable thickneſs and crudity of the Urin.</p>
                     <p>The Remote Cauſes of Epidemical Malignity are: ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to corrupted things, as Dead Carcaſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Salt Subternanean Fumes; Earth-quakes; a preceding famine; eating of corrupt Food, as of putrify'd Summer Fruits, and
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:207638:129"/>drinking Rotten Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Inwardly the prevalent acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Juice of the Pancreas may ſo exalt the Bile to a ruſty ſharp quality, that it becomes malignant. Thus Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign Feavers frequently degenerat into malign ones; and Scorbutic or Hypocondriac Perſons, who are ſtuff'd with a fix'd Acid, are not ſo much oppreſs'd with malignity or a Volatil Acid, as others.</p>
                     <p>The prognoſtics of malignant Feavers are very uncertain, and fallacious. A large and equal Pulſe is a good ſign. A quick and ſmall creeping Pulſe is a bad ſign; as alſo an une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Pulſe; tho' neither the inequality nor intermiſſion, nor ſmallneſs are ſo fatal in malignant as in Benign Feavers. If Doating continue after ſleeping and be not attended by Sweats; if the Eye repreſent falſe Colours of Objects; if the Urine, after apparent Concoction, become Crude again; if it ſtink, if it appear Fat, Oily, black, or livid, with a blackiſh Sediment. If a Looſeneſs happen eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after eruptions upon the Skin; if the Excrements or U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine are Bloody; If the Excrements, Serum, or Blood, ſend forth a heavy Smell; if a redneſs of the Face, Heat and Watchings be attended by a dropping at the Noſe; if the Tendons ſtart; if a tickling or pricking Pain invade the Palms of the Hands; if the Perſon attempts to catch Flies, or pick the Bed-Cloaths; if any of theſe Symptoms appear they threaten Convulſions or Death. Deafneſs tho' it be look'd upon as a diſmal Symptom in the beginning of acute Feavers, meets with a favourable conſtruction about the height of Malignant Feavers. The Eruption of <hi>Bubo</hi>'s and ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Glandules frequently infer the ſolution of the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>The Cure is either deſign'd for preſervation from immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger, or removing the preſent Illneſs. Diſtill'd Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, Camphyr, and alexipharmacal Ingredients are proper Preſervatives. As for the proper Cure of Malignant Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, 'tis perform'd by expelling the poyſonous ferment, and fortifying the Spirits and Humours, in order to promote the expulſion. To this purpoſe, Sulphur, abſorbent Antimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Powders, Camphyr, Vinegar, and Acid Juices; precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating Powders ſuch as the friable parts of Animals, mix'd with <hi>alexipharmacal</hi> Ingredients, ſuch as Zedoary, Ivy-Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Juniper and Bay-berries, Myrrh, <hi>Angelica,</hi> Gentian and Saffron, with Opium and Sudorifics, are very proper. But in order to a regular uſe of 'em, let us mind the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cautions.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="258" facs="tcp:207638:130"/>1. Vomits, eſpecially the Infuſion of <hi>Vitrum Antimonii,</hi> are of admirable efficacy in the very beginning of Malignant Feavers; eſpecially when they're attended by Anxieties in the Breaſt, or proceed from an internal corruption of the Humors. But the Seaſon of exhibiting them muſt be nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weigh'd; for if Nature be already endeavouring any other evacuation, eſpecially through the Skin, they are out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Sudorifics are juſtly look'd upon as the baſis of the Cure; but they ought to be proportion'd to the malignity of the Diſeaſe, and ſtrength of the Patient. If the Maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be of a moderat Character, 'tis adviſable to begin with abſorbents at firſt. Indeed a violent malignity requires pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Sudorifics; but care muſt be taken that the Patient be not ſtifl'd with weight of Cloaths. And thoſe of the ſweating Tribe that are Aromatic and Oily, are only proper in the beginning, or during the increaſe: Towards the height, or when the Heat is violent, 'tis not amiſs to exchange 'em with fix'd Powders or, at leaſt, to qualifie 'em with Acids, ſuch as the Spirits of Nitre, the vegetable Acid Juices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Camphyr is a Sudorific never to be omitted, unleſs it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by a peculiar Antipathy as in ſome Women, and ſtudious Men.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. During the time of ſweating, or immediatly after it, let Acid mixtures of the Juice of Citrons, and eſpecially Spirit of Nitre <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be exhibited. They retrieve the exhauſted Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and procure a due conſiſtence to the diſſolv'd Blood, and ought always to be imploy'd for a Vehicle to <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle, and ſuch like hot Compoſitions.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Opiats are of admirable uſe for promoting Sweat, which is frequently hinder'd by anxiety and unquietneſs. Let 'em be mix'd both with Sudorifics, and with the Acid mixtures exhibited after ſweating; but their proper Seaſon is during the Increaſe; for towards the Criſis they ought to be avoided.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Cure of malignant Feavers varies according to their reſpective Cauſes. If they proceed from external Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, fierce Sudorifics are requir'd. If from the internal corruption of the Humours, they ought to be more temperat, and rather abſorbent. If the Animal Spirits are the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ſeat of the Malignity, ſubtil, volatil, penetrating Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, mix'd with Narcotics, are proper. If the Blood claim that Character, they ought to be temper'd with Acid Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicles. The malignity of the Blood is, for the moſt part, attended by eruptions of Humours at one part or other; that
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:207638:130"/>of the Spirits by Deliriums, Watchings, Convulſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and a tolerable Pulſe.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Malignant Feavers are frequently complicated conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Burning ones; in which caſe regard muſt be had to the boiling heat of the Blood, by inſiſting moſt on moder at Acids, and fix'd abſorbents, eſpecially thoſe of Antimony, and qualifying the volatil oily Specifics.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The above mention'd Symptoms relating to the Tongue, Hands, and Tendons ought always to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd after; as alſo the condition of the Eyes, for if they are rutilant and fiery, or fierce, they threaten <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riums.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8 There is nothing more fatal than a Looſeneſs; and all Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Purgations are pernicious, eſpecially if the Diſeaſe came by Contagion, or if Nature endeavour Cutaneous Frup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or if the force of malignity ſurpaſs that of the febrile efferveſcency. If the firſt Paſſages be ſtuff'd, let temperat Clyſters be injected, and even thoſe but very cautiouſly. In the Declenſion of the Diſeaſe a gentle Laxative is not amiſs.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Blood-letting is highly Pernicious, eſpecially if the Diſeaſe came by Contagion, or tend to cutaneal Eruptions. Sometimes if the malignity be weak, and the Blood boyl high in a Plethoric young Perſon, accuſtom'd to Bleeding, it may be allow'd; but with a great deal of Caution and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Bliſtering Plaiſters are very uſeful. They're appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Legs and Arms, and in caſe of ſleepy Symptoms to the Nap of the Neck. If the Animal Spirits are much afflicted, or if the Eruptions deſign'd by nature advance but ſlowly or retire afterwards, they are of ſingular uſe. <hi>Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> adviſes us not to be over haſty in applying 'em, till Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have diſcover'd her deſign, and then if ſhe be weak to interpoſe their help. The increaſe or rather beginning of the Height is a proper time to apply 'em.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. The Diet muſt be thin; neither are Victuals to be offer'd unleſs the appetit require 'em. For Drink, let Water be boyl'd with a third part of Rheniſh Wine, and mix'd with the Juice of Citrons and Gelly of Harts-horn. Or let Whey be ſharpen'd with the Juice of Citrons, or Spirit of Nitre.</p>
                     <p>Having premis'd theſe Cautions, we ſhall next touch at the Specifics, ſome of which are volatil, ſome fix'd. The vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til are either lean and thin, ſuch as the Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi>
                        <pb n="260" facs="tcp:207638:131"/>the Spirits and volatil Salts of Harts-horn, of Vipers, of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, of Urine, of Amber, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or Oily and Aromatic, ſuch as Camphyr, Elecampane, Birthwort, Rue, Galangal, Mary-gold, Orange Peel, Germander, Caſtor, Vipers, Baum, Zedoary, leſſer Centory, Rob of Juniper and Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries the diſtill'd Oyls of Amber, Camphyr, Harts-horn, and Tartar; Eſſence of Triacle; Spirit of Triacle Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoris'd, and the Eſſences of Aromatic Herbs. The fix'd are Diaphoretic Antimony, Diaphoretic Gold, native Cinnabar, or that of Antimony, above all the fix'd Sulphur of Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, mineral Bezoar both ſimple and Compound, the Bezoar Stone given to half a dram, or in the room of it the Stone cut out of a Man's Bladder, ſeal'd Earth, Coral, Harts-horn, Sulphur, and the preparations of Nitre, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some are of a temperat nature, neither properly volatil nor fix'd; ſuch are the Gelly of Harts-horn, the expelling Seeds, <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> Columbines, Creſſes, Citrons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which we may add Myrrh, which is a baumy Medicine, of excellent uſe for covering the Spirits from the ſhocks of the malign ferment.</p>
                     <p>From theſe Simples are prepar'd an infinity of compound Medicines, ſuch as Venice Triacle, or Diaſcordium (which is better) Mithridat, Species of Hyacinth, the Powder call'd <hi>Saxonicus</hi> &amp;c. As for Venice Triacle and ſuch like hot Compoſitions, the beſt way is to exhibit em in Acid Vehicles, and mix 'em with fix'd Specifics.</p>

                     <p>When the Diſeaſe is further advanc'd towards the height, volatil Sulphureous Medicines muſt be cautiouſly us'd. As, take of Fumitory Water, three ounces; Harts-horn prepar'd without Fire, two ſcruples; mineral Bezoar, a ſcruple; extract of Treacle, ſix grains; Syrup of Orange Peel, three drams.

                     <p>During the uſe of theſe or ſuchlike Alexipharmacal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, let Acid Mixtures be exhibited for quenching the Thirſt, and comforting the Spirits after ſweating. As,</p>
                     <p>Take two freſh Citrons, ſlice 'em. Add of white Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, three ounces; Vipers-graſs Roots, two or three drams; Spring Water, ſix pound. Boyl them till two parts of three be evaporated, and ſtrain it for uſe.</p>

                     <p>Take of the ſhavings of Saſſafras, ſix drams; boyl them in Water, to a pound and a half of the ſtrain'd Liquor add two ounces of the Juice of Citrons, an ounce and a half of the Syrup of Citrons, and a ſufficient quantity of the Spirit of Nitre, to render it grateful.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Decoction of Tamarinds with Raiſins a Pound; Syrup of the Juice of Citrons, Syrup of Rasberries, of each an ounce; with a little of the Spirit of Nitre, make a Potion.</p>
                     <pb n="263" facs="tcp:207638:132"/>
                     <p>Sometimes the Confection Alkermes, or Diaſcordium, or Diaphoretic Antimony is diſſolv'd in theſe acid mixtures.</p>
                     <p>During the time of Swearing ſome apply a little Loaf hot from the Oven, the under Cruſt being par'd off, and the Heart excavated and fill'd with Triacle and Wine; thus they apply it to the Navel to attract the Malignity.</p>
                     <p>If the Patient bleed at Noſe, which is a fatal Symptom, apply a dry Toad to the Arm-pits; or, take of Vervain Water, three ounces; Spirit of Wine Comphoris'd, an ounce; Opium, five grains. Make an Epithema for the Forehead; which is alſo of uſe to prevent Head-achs and Delirium's. If the Stomac be much diſorder'd, apply to it a Plaiſter of Tacamphac, Balſam of <hi>Peru</hi> and Venice Triacle. If the Throat and Palat be dry, without a ſlimy Cruſt, make a Gargle of fair Water, Spirit of Wine rectify'd, and Hony.</p>
                     <p>If a Looſeneſs attend a malignant Feaver, exhibit two ſcruples of the red Powder of Pannonia; or Venice Triacle mix'd with Opium and fix'd Sudorifics Prepar'd Harts-horn, Bole Armenic, ſeal'd Earth, mineral Unicorn, are alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be added to Alexipharmacal Ingredients.</p>
                     <p>If a malignant Feaver be attended by Heartburnings, and gnawings of the Stomac, violent Head-achs, Watchings, Deliriums, and a grievous <hi>Prunella,</hi> 'tis call'd the Hungarian, or Camp Feaver, and is highly Contagious. Vomits com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence its Cure; which ought be follow'd by Acid Juleps, and fix'd or meagre Sudorifics. The Hungarians are wont to Cure it by rubbing the Body with a Root of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſoak'd in Spirit of Wine, and bruis'd; and then covering up the Perſon in order to Sweat. The <hi>Prunella</hi> is accounted for by waſhing the Mouth with a mixture of Houſe-leek Water, Juice of Houſe-leek, and <hi>Sal-Armoniac.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some malignant Feavers are accompany'd by Spots in the Skin reſembling Flea-bitings. Theſe Spots are alſo compatible to ſome Tertian and Scorbutic Feavers that are not tinctur'd with Malignity. When they attend malign Feavers, they are uſher'd in by theſe Symptoms, <hi>viz.</hi> an univerſal bruiſing, tearing Pain, and Wearineſs, a ſudden and unaccountable decay of Strength, and a moderat Heat, with little or no Sickneſs at firſt; follow'd by heavy pains of the Back and Head, Watchings, Unquietneſs and anxiety; towards the Evening they grow worſe, and continue ſo all Night. In the Beginning of the Diſeaſe they Sweat eaſily; during its further progreſs they Sweat but little or with great difficulty,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:207638:133"/>and in the height of the Diſeaſe, none at all, either natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or artificially. About the fourth, ſeventh, or tenth Day, the Spots break forth in the Breaſt and Shoulders, afterwards on the Belly and Legs, and at length in the Arms, the Face being for the moſt part free. In the Declenſion or even in the height of the Diſeaſe, ſometimes there inſues a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſalivation. The Spots are diſtinguiſh'd from fleabitings by this Mark, that theſe have a red point in their middle, which the Spots have not, and that they diſappear by the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Meal of Beans with Vinegar.</p>
                     <p>If theſe Spots are many, large, broad, and of a high Colour, 'tis a good ſign. But if they are few in number, apt to retire, or of a Yellow, Green, Blew, or above all of a Black Colour, 'tis a deſperat Caſe. If they break out before we can diſcover any ſigns of Concoction, or after their erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are follow'd by a bleeding at the Noſe, 'tis an ill Omen. If during the firſt Days of the illneſs the Perſon walk'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout and expos'd himſelf to Cold, 'tis an aggravating cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance. In general, all ſpotted Feavers are flow and leſs acute than others.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe is the ſame, as that of other malignant Feavers, as alſo the general Cure. What peculiarly belongs to ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Feavers is couch'd under the following Cautions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Vomits are of excellent uſe. Purgation and oft-times injecting of Clyſters is noxious, if the Spots are already out. 2. Blood-leting is fatal. 3. In the Beginning and Increaſe, Venice Triacle, and ſuch like conpoſitions, may ſafely be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited. But towards the height thoſe of a fix'd Quality are preferable. 4. If the eruption be Symptomatical, it ought not be promoted by Sudorifics, but rather moderated by Acid Antidots. If 'tis Critical, following the ſigns of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and affording ſome relief to the Patient, it ought to be gently incourag'd by Emulſions of the expelling Seeds. 5. A Looſeneſs following the eruption ought to be cautiouſly handled. 'Tis not fit to ſtop it directly: but only to perſiſt in the uſe of ſweating Medicines; or if it occaſion the retreat of the Spots, then we may adventure to curb it gently. 6. Bliſtering Plaiſters are of Sovereign uſe, eſpecially if the Spots diſappear unſeaſonably. 7. Wine moderatly taken is not improper.</p>
                     <p>There is another ſort of malignant Feaver, call'd <hi>Purpura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> which approaches to the nature of acute Feavers, both in timing its Criſis, and the Symptoms that uſher it in. Under the increaſe of the Diſeaſe the Perſon is ſeiz'd with a notable
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:207638:133"/>Heat, and pricking Pains all round the Breaſt, Shoulders, Neck, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Skin becomes rough and red, and ſometimes itches, and in the height of the Diſeaſe is cover'd with little miliar Eruptions, which are apt to ſtrike in upon the leaſt Cold whatſoever, And in the declenſion of the Diſeaſe fall off like Scales. This Diſeaſe frequently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks Women in Child-bed, perhaps by reaſon of the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of their Lochias. It ſeems to partake much of a Scorbutic nature, and therefore Antiſcorbutics mix'd with other Antidors are very proper. In fine, its Cure is the ſame as that of other malignant Feavers, to which we may add, that all Purgatives, or Clyſters, or the leaſt degree of Cold, ought to be nicely avoided.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Of the ſmall Pox and Meaſles.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE ſmall Pox are not always malignant, as being only an effect of Nature's indeavours to purify the Blood from the vicious remains of Milk ſuckt from the Breaſts in our infancy, and curdled into an Acid. Some fancy them to proceed from the Corruption of Menſtrual Blood, with which the Child is tainted in the Womb. But the weakneſs of that thought is ſufficiently evinc'd, by the unequal propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Children to this Diſeaſe, and their being nouriſh'd with Chyle in the Womb.</p>
                     <p>That the corruption of the Milk, and its degeneracy into an Acid, is the cauſe of the ſmall Pox may be infer'd, from the Analogy that intercedes betwixt them and the Scurfy ſtinking Ulcers in the Heads of Children, caus'd by vicious Milk.</p>
                     <p>This Acid cauſes the convulſions and tearing pains of the Back and other Membrans of the Body, the piercing of the Skin, ſuppuration, and in ſhort, all the Symptoms of the ſmall Pox, whether common or uncommon. Now the order of the common Symptoms is as follows.</p>
                     <pb n="266" facs="tcp:207638:134"/>
                     <p>A gentle ſhivering is follow'd by a violent Heat, and heavyneſs of the Back and whole Body, piercing beating pains in the Loyns, a ſwelling, redneſs and ſcorching pain of the Eyes, and an aptneſs to ſhed Tears, or void Serum, and ſometimes a weighty Pain in the Head; or a dry Cough, with a quick, frequent, vehement and hard Pulſe. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration is oft-times difficult, the Throat rough, and the Voice hoarſe. The Perſon is diſquieted, watches much, or dreams of uncouth things, or doats and undergoes ſome epileptic motions. Sometimes he vomits or bleeds at Noſe, which is a bad Symptom in the height, tho' not in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Diſeaſe; or piſſes Blood; or is ſeiz'd with a Diabete or a Looſeneſs. The Urine is for the moſt part clear, by reaſon that the Serum moves towards the ſurface of the Body. Sometimes indeed when the Blood and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors boil high within, 'tis muddy or white, and drops a ſediment like Bran.</p>
                     <p>Of all theſe Signs there are three that are moſt certain, <hi>viz.</hi> a Pain in the Loyns or Back, and a diſtending Pain and watryneſs of the Eyes.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Symptoms gall the Patient 'till the third or fourth day that little red Spots appear; and then if they advance regularly, the Symptoms diſappear. Theſe Spots ſometimes vaniſh inſenſibly in a few days, and are call'd Meaſles; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they riſe in the form of red Puſhes, and by degrees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come white in the Center, with a purple or livid Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Thus they come to ſuppurat, tho' not without a ſort of renewed Feaver, and in the middle void corrupt matter, and fall off like Scales, under the denomination of the Small-Pox.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Spots or Wheals chiefly poſſeſs the Hands and Face, and bloat 'em up, and frequently leave behind 'em Ulcers in the Head and other parts of the Body, eſpecially if they do not come duly forth, or ſtrike in unſeaſonably: In which caſe an infinity of various Ills may inſue.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſtics, they are accounted favourable when the Symptoms diſappear, or at leaſt remit, upon the Eruption; when they break out ſpeedily, copiouſly, and all together; when the Puſhes are large, foft, pointed at the Top, round, ſeparated from one another, of a red Colour, becoming quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly white in the middle, and retaining a red Circumference; when they are moſt numerous in the extreme Parts, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the fourth day, ripening quickly, and finiſhing their Courſe by the fourteenth. The dangerous Symptoms
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:207638:134"/>are juſt the reverſe of theſe: To which we may add Pits or black Points in the middle of the Puſhes, a livid Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, the interjection or following of malignant Spots, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive motions continuing after the Eruption, moiſt Hands while the Arms are very dry; the diſtention and murmuring of the Belly, attended by Anxiety and Unquietneſs (betoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Inflammation of the Inteſtins) the continuance of the Feaver and difficult Reſpiration after the Eruption, ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Bowels Lungs, Midriff, and internal Parts are inflam'd and beſet with Wheals; violent Pains of the Back, accompany'd by an unaccountable Weakneſs, and malignant Symptoms; piſſing Blood, or voiding Blood either upwards or downwards, Looſeneſſes and Bleeding at Noſe following the Eruption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sometimes indeed Bleeding at Noſe in the beginning of the Sickneſs in a large quantity, and without the leaſt Interruption, and ceaſing of its own accord, is a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Circumſtance. Some have obſerv'd that the Children of Parents, who were pox'd before Marriage, are always in great danger when attack'd by the Small-Pox. Thoſe who dye of this Diſeaſe, are ſeiz'd with Quinſies, or a ſtuffing of the Lungs, Looſeneſſes, Dyſenteries or Convulſions. If they recover, the Eyes are in danger of being damag'd; the Lungs and Guts of being ulcerated; the external Parts of Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthmes; and the whole Body of Obſtructions and Cachex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies.</p>
                     <p>The Cure is perform'd by moderating the ſharp Ferment, expelling it when corrected, and mitigating the Symptoms. In order to a regular purſuit of theſe Ends, let's obſerve the following Cautions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. We ought to diſtinguiſh the time of Separation from that of Expulſion. During the former the Blood boyls high, and ought not to be ſpurr'd on by expelling Medicines, (unleſs the Patient be very weak) but appeas'd and arm'd againſt the Influence of the malign <hi>Miaſma</hi>'s, by abſorbent fixing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients. But during the latter Alexipharmical and expelling Medicines, eſpecially Emulſions of the expelling Seeds, ought to be exhibited and perſiſted in till the Puſhes diſappear.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. During the Progreſs of the Diſeaſe, Purges or Clyſters are highly pernicious. In the beginning of the Feaver, if it be very high and free of Malignity, and if the ſick Perſon's firſt Paſſages be ſtuff'd, 'tis not improper to exhibit a gentle Laxative with ſweet Mercury. After the Declination of the Pox or Meaſles, 'tis highly neceſſary to purge with the ſame
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:207638:135"/>Ingredients, in order to prevent the Influence of the acid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If a Looſeneſs happen after the Eruption, we ought to be cautious of ſuppreſſing it, eſpecially if the Feaver be not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, and the Humors be putrify'd within. In this caſe we ought ſtill to perſiſt in the uſe of Sudorifics, which divert the Humors to the Surface of the Body. In other Caſes a ſymptomatical Looſneſs ought to be ſtopp'd by adding Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents. If it proceed from Worms it's frequently fatal.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Blood-letting (in <hi>Germany</hi>) is highly pernicious; unleſs the Patient be of a full Plethoric Conſtitution, and ſeis'd with a Frenſie; and even then it only takes place in the beginning before the Eruption.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Opiats are of excellent uſe for promoting Expulſion, mitigating the pernicious Symptoms of the Nerves and lower Belly; and for incouraging the ſwelling of the Hands and Face, which is a moſt favourable Circumſtance in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. After Recovery, the Lungs, Throat, Belly, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal parts ought to be arm'd againſt the influence of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining acid.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. External Applications for preventing Scars and Pits, are very prejudicial, eſpecially before Maturation. The moſt uſeful External is Bracelets of Amber applied to the Wriſts, which promote the Expulſion.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. If the Feaver be high during the time of Separation, avoid too much Heat. If the Patient be weak, and Nature unable to perform its part, artificial Heat is not improper.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. During the time of Separation the Diet muſt be thin. Wine is improper; the Decoctions of Lentils, or of any ſort of Pulſe, are flatulent and prejudicial. Let Gelly of Harts-horn be diſſolv'd in ſmall Beer, mixt with the Tincture of Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, or, in which a Bag of Columbine and Turnep Seeds is infus'd, for ordinary drinking. For Children let hot Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Dung be infus'd in what they drink for it promotes Sweat, and defends the Neck and Throat.</p>
                     <p>Having premis'd theſe Cautions, the next thing is to take a view of the <hi>Materia Medica.</hi> For moderating the motion of the Blood, and mitigating the Symptoms of the Breaſt and Belly, and promoting Expulſion, we uſe mineral Unicorn, diaphoretic Antimony, Cinnabar of Antimony (of excellent uſe for preventing Convulſions) and eſpecially Unicorn's horn and Emulſion of the expulſive Seeds, <hi>viz.</hi> The Seeds of Creſſes, Columbines, Turneps, and <hi>Carduus Benedictus.</hi> To
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:207638:135"/>which we add ſome volatil Ingredients, ſuch as the Salt and Spirits of Harts-horn Vipers and Human Blood, when the Acid afflicts the Nerves, and the Puſhes break out but ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                     <p>The ſpecific Remedies of great Note, are Myrrh, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, or their Eſſences, prepar'd with Spirit of Wine tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris'd. To which we may add Saffron, the Dung of Animals, eſpecially Horſe's or Sheep's Dung infus'd in Wine: Figs, or their Decoction, to which we add Millet Seeds, to quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their looſening Virtue.</p>
                     <p>Take of Harts-horn prepar'd without Fire, and Diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Antimony, of each fifteen grains; Myrrh, half a ſcruple. Make a Powder, to be exhibited before the Eruption. If the Patient be troubled with a ſhivering juſt upon the point of Eruption, add the Salt of <hi>Carduus Benedictus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of Harts-horn prepar'd without Fire, and Cinnabar of Antimony, of each half a ſcruple; Caſtor, three grains; Myrrh, two grains; volatil Salt of Vipers, four or five grains. Make a Powder to be given after eruption, or when the Puſhes advance but ſlowly. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of Harts-horn prepar'd without Fire fifteen grains; ſolar Bezoar, half a ſcruple; volatil Salt of Harts-horn, five grains; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> half a grain. Mix for one Doſe. In caſe of a looſeneſs, or unquietneſs and malignity, add two grains of Camphyr. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of Scabious Water, an ounce and a half; Eſſence of Myrrh, a Dram; Harts-horn prepar'd without Fire, a ſcruple; Mineral Bezoar, half a ſcruple; <hi>Laudanum</hi> prepar'd by fermentation, a Grain; Syrup of <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> three Drams. Make a Potion The volatil Salt of Vipers, or that of Harts-horn, Camphyr, <hi>Sennertus</hi>'s Bezoardic Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Spirit of Treacle, and, in caſe of a Looſeneſs, ſeal'd Earth, may be added by turns.</p>
                     <p>Take of the yellow part of Orange Peel, two drams; Citron Seeds, a dram; Seeds of Columbines and <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> Myrrh, of each half a dram; ſweet Almonds, a dram. With Viper-Graſs-water make an Emulſion, and ſweeten it. If the Patient be much diſquieted, add the Syrup of Poppies and Eſſence of Caſtor.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Tincture of <hi>Tartar,</hi> two drams; Eſſence of Myrrh, prepar'd with the Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> a dram. Mix and exhibit forty or fifty drops a day towards the height of the Diſeaſe, or when the Puſnes are well advanc'd, and the Symptoms mitigate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. After a ſufficient eruption,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:207638:136"/>we ought to promote their ſuppuration, and prevent Pits in the Skin, by exhibiting a Compound Powder of Crabs-Eyes, Harts-horn, Myrrh, and Salt of <hi>Carduus Benedictus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides the direct indications of the ſmall <hi>Pox</hi> and <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſles,</hi> we ought likewiſe to obviat their incident Symptoms, as unquietneſs and inolination to vomit, if it be proper to ſtop it, by the Spirit of Harts-horn ſuccinated, and Extract of Treacle, mix'd with <hi>Laudanum Opiatum;</hi> a looſeneſs towards the height, accompany'd with a murmuring noiſe in the Belly, and frothy Excrements, by ſeal'd Earth, or <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum Opiatum</hi> and <hi>Diaſcordium,</hi> mix'd with other ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fics; Watchings, Deliriums, and Convulſions, attended with a hardneſs of the Belly, by exhibiting the Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabar of Antimony, or Spirit of Harts-horn ſuccinated; or injecting Clyſters, anointing the Navel and pit of the Stomac with diſtill'd Oyl of Amber; and, in the beginning of the Diſeaſe, injecting Clyſters. A bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Noſe ought to be promoted, if needs be, by ſqueez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or pricking the Noſtrils; or, if it exceed meaſure, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd by applying dry'd Toads to the Arm-pits, or mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Narcotics with Abſorbents, and avoiding all volatil Ingredients. A Cough, or any diſorder of the Breaſt, ought to be repreſs'd by Scabious Water mix'd with Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi> aniſated, and <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> adding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eruption, incraſſating Syrrups, ſuch as thoſe of Colts-foot, Jujubes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and after the eruption, attenuating ones, ſuch as thoſe of Tobacco, Mint, Hyſſop, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and proſtration of ſtrength ought to be repair'd by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting the Tincture of Coral mix'd, with the Spirit of Stag's Heart, or a Toaſt ſoak'd in Rheniſh Wine.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Symptoms laſt mention'd precede the Eruption. Thoſe which follow the Eruption, are likewiſe to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for. As if the Pox or Meaſles retire unſeaſonably, and fall upon the nervous Syſtem, cauſing Deliriums, and Convulſions, apply bliſtering Plaiſters to the Soles of the Feet, and exhibit the Aſhes of Scarlet Cloth in Wine. If the ſharpneſs of the Humour threaten Pits in the Face, exhibit Crabs Eyes and Myrrh inwardly; and apply out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly with a Feather, the Spirit of Wine tinctur'd with Myrrh, or Roſe-water, in which Sugar of Lead is diſſolv'd, or the Plaiſter of Frogs Spawn with Sugar of Lead: But all external applications before maturation are much ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, for fear of repreſſing the Matter. Lime-water in which Sulphur is boil'd, being mix'd with Roſe-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:207638:136"/>or a Cataplaſm of the Meal of Beans and that of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines and Ox Urine are of uſe for taking off the Scarrs. If a Salivation ſucceed to the Eruption, let the Patient drink plentifully of Barly Water, or ſmall Beer, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe gargle his Mouth with it.</p>
                     <p>If the ſmall Pox or Meaſles threaten Injury to the Eyes, either by ſettling in the Apple of the Eye, or diſtending the Eye-Lid, let the Eye be waſh'd with the infuſion of the Glaſs of <hi>Antimony</hi> in Plantan and Roſe-Water, with Tut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Sugar of Lead. If the Eyes be red and itch, apply a piece of raw Beef to the Eye, renewing it every quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an Hour for ſome time. Or let a healthy Woman chew Garlic, and breath upon the Eye; or waſh the Eye with the juice of Chervil or Rue, mix'd with Fennel Water; or make a Collyrium of Plantan, Night-ſhade and Roſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in which Sumac and Plantan Seeds are boil'd, or the Rinds of Pomgranats infus'd. The mucilage of Marſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallows extracted with Fennel Water; or the infuſion of white Vitriol and Tutty in Eye-bright Water; or Plantan-Water mix'd with Frogs Spawn, and Sugar of Lead; are alſo very proper. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of Plantan-Water an Ounce; Eye-bright and Roſe Water, of each half an ounce; prepar'd Emerald, twelve grains; prepar'd Pearls, ſix grains; Camphyr, three grains; Saffron, four grains. Mix and drop it into the Eye. Some chooſe to drop into the Eye, a drop or two of the Fat of Vipers.</p>
                     <p>If the Eye-lids are beſet with the Pox, and inflam'd not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all theſe Precautions; apply the Decoction of Line-ſeed, Fenugrec-ſeed, and Mallows, or that of Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot-Flowers, and Quince-ſeeds. Some apply Milk; but I cannot approve their Practice, ſince 'tis apt to become Acid. If, after all, the Eyes be injur'd, and remain ſo after reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Pox, 'tis proper to uſe <hi>Rulandus</hi>'s Opthalmic Water, and apply Bliſtering-Plaiſters to the Nape of the Neck, and when that Bliſter ceaſes to run, apply two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Ears, mixing one part of the Bliſtering Plaiſter with five or ſix parts of the Plaiſter of Frogs-ſpawn, to keep the Bliſter open.</p>
                     <p>If the Pox injure the Noſe or Ears, the former is reliev'd by applying Vinegar of Roſes impregnated with Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyr, and anointing the Cruſts within the Noſtrils (if there be any ſuch) with freſh Butter, waſh'd in Roſe-water. The latter, <hi>viz.</hi> The Ears are reſtor'd by putting into the Ears
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:207638:137"/>the Eſſence of Caſtor with Cotton, or fumigating it with the Decoction of Caſtor, Myrrh, Coloquintida, Fennel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed, and a little Saffron in Wine; and applying Bliſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Plaiſters behind them.</p>
                     <p>The Throat is frequently infeſted by the ſmall Pox, and conſequently reſpiration diſturb'd. To prevent this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, let the Mouth and Throat be waſh'd with Goats Milk and Plantan Water, or the Tincture of Poppy-Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or with the common Gargles mix'd with Horſe's Dung, or the Juice of River Crabs and Nitre. After the Wheals are open, 'twill not be improper to add Allum and Honey of Roſes. Plantan is alſo a noted Specific both againſt this Symptom, and that of piſſing Blood.</p>
                     <p>If the Tongue be ulcerated, apply Honey of Roſes ſharpen'd with Spirit of Salt, or the following Liniment, <hi>viz.</hi> Take of the Flowers of Holyhocks, half an Ounce; Pomgranat Flowers, two drams; choice Myrrh, a Dram; Allum half a dram; with Hony make a Liniment, or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuary.</p>
                     <p>If the Lips be much in trouble, anoint 'em with the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilage of the Seeds of Quinces. Sometimes the ſmall Pox leave moſt obſtinate Ulcers in the Head, Breaſts, and other parts, which elude all common methods, and yield only to Mercurial Salivations.</p>
                     <p>The Scarlet Feaver is generally referr'd to the Meaſles. It invades, for the moſt part, Children, and is occaſion'd by an Ebullition of the Lymph, and attended by the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of a Catarrh. It is in ſome meaſure acute, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter three or four Days from its beginning, breaks out in the Neck, Shoulders and Breaſt, either in the form of an equal redneſs reſembling a Roſe, or that of diſpers'd red Spots, which fall off about the ſeventh Day like Scales. It is cur'd as the Meaſles or ſmall Pox, but has this peculiar property, that 'tis follow'd by ſoft ſwellings in the Face and Legs, that laſt for eight Days after its diſappearance.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THE Plague is an exalted pitch of Malignity, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible with any Diſeaſe whatſoever. In this place we take it for an epidemical, catching, and highly malignant Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, proceeding from poiſonous Miaſma's in the Air, and attended by fiery Botches, Bubo's, Carbuncles, or malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Spots. This Miaſm is volatil and ſpirituous, and fir for encountering Mens Spirits, and defiling the vital Spirit of the Air. Perhaps it approaches near to the nature of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenic. The Paſſions of the Mind, Fear, and Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſubterranean Damps let looſe by Earth-quakes, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, corruption of dead Bodies, and ſuch like, are its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote cauſes. When this poiſonous Miaſm afflicts Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, it joins to the Human Spirits, and diſperſes it ſelf where theſe meet with the readieſt reception; upon which account, Relations are liable to the Contagion, tho' in diſtant places; and the Beaſts are ſecure, when Mankind falls an univerſal Sacrifice.</p>
                     <p>The Plague is not always accompany'd by a Feaver. When Nature is weak, it yields to the oppreſſion, and makes no Feaveriſh reſiſtance. The Symptoms are the ſame as thoſe of Malignant Feavers, rais'd to the higheſt pitch; to which we may add ſwellings in the Arm-pits, Groin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Ears, or in any glandulous place, with a pricking ſhooting pain in the middle; Botches, and Carbuncles in the Fingers, Noſtrils, Eyes and Lips; ſometimes fatal Black-ſpors, or malignant Ulcers all over the Body; a ſudden proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſtrength, violent pains of the Head, without any cauſe, or following the paſſion of fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the degeneracy of the Pulſe from being large and ſwift, to a ſmall, languid, intermitting, unequal ſtate; and a burning heat within, but moderat on the external ſurface of the Body. An imminent
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:207638:138"/>Plague is foretold from unwonted ſwarms of Inſects reſort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Country.</p>
                     <p>The Prognoſtics of a Plague are very fallacious: 'Tis an acute Diſeaſe, ending ſometimes in Twenty four Hours, ſometimes in two, three, or ſeven Days; in general, thoſe who are ſcabby or Pocky are in leaſt danger, as being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by their peccant Acid. Preceding Fatigue or Fear are bad Omens. Black livid Spots are a worſe Symptom, than Carbuncles, and theſe worſe than Bubo's. Scars or Marks of mortification are always fatal. Many and large Bubo's are a good ſign, as alſo copious Sweats. But cold Sweats, or many Carbuncles; coldneſs of the extream Parts, eſpecially the Noſe; a livid circumference ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſwellings; Carbuncles growing upon Bubo's in places full of Tendons; the imperfect eruption or retreat of the Tumors; a Hiccough ſucceeding to the eruption; the white, blue, or livid Colour of Carbuncles, while the Feaver is not abated; Pains of the Throat, and difficulty of ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, attending Bubo's in the Neck, or behind the Ears; are all fatal Symptoms. If bliſtering Plaiſters raiſe no Bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, 'tis an infallible ſign of Death in all Diſeaſes. If a Cautery applied raiſe a white Cruſt after the application, or if the place be dry, or not cover'd with Puſhes, and the Botch continue to ſpread further, or if Iſſues dry up of a ſudden, 'tis a deſperat caſe. Carbuncles in the Stomac, Guts, Bladder, Eyes, and Noſtrils, are plain indications of Death. Anxiety of the Breaſt without a Feaver, frequent ſneezing, a Looſeneſs, Hiccough, Vomiting, Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Hoarſeneſs, a flux of Blood by Urine or Saliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and in ſhort, all the diſmal circumſtances of malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Feavers (related above) are the Companions of fatal Plagues. A continual Coſtiveneſs, and numerous Puſhes, fill'd with laudable Matter, appearing after the Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Cautery to any part, are look'd upon as hopeful Signs.</p>
                     <p>The Cure divides it ſelf into two Branches. The firſt is that of preſerving from imminent danger; the ſecond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcues from actual Oppreſſion. Preſervatives regard either the Air, the common Vehicle of Contagion, or the Bodies of People. As for the former, the Air is purifi'd by the ſhooting of Cannon, by burning Gun-powder, or Nitre and Sulphur with Amber, Myrrh, Camphyr, Pitch, Benzoin, and Juniper Berries; by throwing the Mineral acid Spirits, or Vinegar in which Vitriol and Verdigreaſe are infus'd,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:207638:138"/>together with Camphyr, upon hot Bricks; by burning of Goats Horns, and filling the Air with ungrateful Smells, ſuch as that of a Houſe of Office, of Hogs Dung, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The other ſort of Preſervatives, arm the Body and Spirits againſt the aſſaults of the contagious Miaſms. For this end, we ought to avoid faſting or going abroad before eating. Butter and Rue Leaves, and a draught of good generous Wine, upon which Camphyr has been kindled, are fit to be taken in a Morning: as alſo the Mineral acid Spirits, and the acid Juices of Fruits; but above all, Vinegar impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with the Vertue of Camphyr, Myrrh, Juniper-Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Zedoary, and other aromatic Simples. Next to Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar are the ſulphureous balmy Ingredients, eſpecially Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, Myrrh, and Amber, which cover the Spirits from the attacks of the morbific Matter, and ought to be taken in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid Vehicles. To theſe we may add <hi>Opium</hi> and <hi>Diaſcordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi> Venice Treacle, and ſuch like hot Compoſitions ought to be cautiouſly us'd, and always diſſolv'd in Vinegar. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar of Lead alſo given with Camphyr from four to ten grains, is of excellent uſe, but 'tis very volatil, and, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreetly us'd, may accelerat the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Externally, there is nothing equals the cutting of Iſſues. A Spunge wet with Aromatic Vinegar impregnated with Myrrh and Camphyr, may frequently be applied to the Noſtrils. Let Ginger and Zedoary, or Troches made of Myrrh and Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyr, and Tragacanth diſſolv'd in Vinegar, be often chew'd and held in the Mouth. Let the Temples, Wriſts, and Breaſts be anointed with the Apop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ectic Balſam, mix'd with Camphyr; let <hi>Sala</hi>'s <hi>magnes Arſenicalis,</hi> mix'd with Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoin diſſolv'd in Spirit of Wine, be form'd into Tablets, and hung in a ſcarlet Cloth-Bag upon the Breaſt. If the Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion proceed from ſubrerranean Damps, let dry'd Toads be hung over the Breaſt; If it proceed from the Air, let Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſtand in their room. Some recommend crude Mercury calcin'd by the fumes of Lead for the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>The direct Cure of the Plague conſiſts in expelling the poiſonous Miaſma's by Alexipharmacal Medicines. For the regular performance of which, the following Cautions will be of uſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Let Sudoriſics be repeated every eight Hours even after the eruption of Bubo's or Carbuncles; and after ſweating, exhibit a Cordial Draught mix'd with acid Spirits, for thickning the Blood, and rallying the diſpers'd Spirits.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="276" facs="tcp:207638:139"/>2. Avoid ſleep in time of ſweating, and for that end, apply Vinegar mix'd with Camphyr, or Caſtor, to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If the Sudorific cannot procure Sweat, let a hot Loaf of Bread be excavated and fill'd with <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle and Spirit of Wine camphoris'd, and applied to the Stomac, or Navel, the under Cruſt being taken off.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If obſtinat Watchings threaten Deliriums, and prevent Swea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, let <hi>Laudanum Opiatum</hi> be added to Sudorifics, in order to procure ſleep after ſweating.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. If the fermentation be faint and low, <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle and Mithridat are proper. But if the Feaver be high, and attended by a violent heat, they are fitly exchang'd with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonial Powders, and lixivious Salts.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Acids mix'd with Sudorifics are always proper.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Bliſtering Plaiſters are appli'd with extraordinary ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to the Neck, Legs and Arms. They ought to be very ſharp, and after they're remov'd, the Bliſters kept open with the Plaiſter of Melilot, cover'd with the Powder of <hi>Cantha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides.</hi> But if the Bladder be inflam'd, or the Urine hot; if the Patient be very weak, or with Child, or look for her Terms, they are improper.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Blood-letting is always pernicious.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. In the beginning of the Diſeaſe Vomits are very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. They ought to be mix'd with Sudorifics. Purgatives and Clyſters are not ſafe.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. If the Patient be moleſted with a vomiting, ſo that Sudorifics cannot be retain'd in the Stomac, let Sweat be forc'd, by applying a hot Loaf as above, and covering up the Body and Face.</p>
                     <p>The Specifics that are us'd in this Diſeaſe, are Camphyr given in ſubſtance, or its Oyl mix'd with Oyl of Amber, and that of Citron Peel, called <hi>Heinſius</hi>'s Oyl; Ivy-Berries, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a Dram in Vinegar and Wine; Juniper and Elder Berries, and the Rob of either given in Vinegar; Garlic Heads bruis'd and exhibited in Vinegar; the Blood of a Stork, or its volatil Salt; the Spirit of Harts-horn ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with its own volatil Salt, and given to a Dram; the volatil Salt of Vipers (above all) ſprinkl'd with Oyl of Amber, and mix'd with Camphyr; Man's Ordure applied externally to Bubo's, and given internally with the Patient's own Urine; Sulphur or its Flowers given to a Dram in an acid Vehicle; or rather the fix'd Sulphurs of Antimony, which in this caſe ſurpaſſes all other Medicines; the Oyl
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:207638:139"/>and volatil Salt of Amber; and Diaſcordium given to two drams in Aromatic Vinegar.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Flowers of Sulphur, half a dram; Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar of Antimony, fifteen Grains; Camphry, ſix Grains. Make a Powder. The volatil Salt of Vipers, or that of Harts-horn, or prepar'd Amber may be added by turns.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Rob of Juniper, three ounces; Diaſcordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um and Mithridat, of each an ounce and a half; <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle, half an ounce; Flowers of Sulphur, two or three ounces; Myrrh, three drams; Frankincenſe, ſix drams; Camphyr, two drams; Saffron, half a dram; Juice of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, half an ounce. Make an Electuary. Doſe a dram and a half in a convenient Vehicle.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Water <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> an Ounce and a half; Vinegar of Wine, ſix drams; Diaſcordium, a dram and a half; Camphyr, ſix grains; Syrup of the Juice of Citrons, half an Ounce. Make a Potion for one or two Doſes.</p>
                     <p>Take of hot Verdigreaſe a Pound, ſprinkle it with three Ounces of diſtill'd Vinegar; diſtill through a Retort in Sand, with an intenſe heat; then add to the Spirit thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd, a double quantity of rectifi'd Spirit of Tartar; and half a dram of Camphyr, and a little Opium for every Ounce of the compound Spirit; and let all ſtand for dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. This is call'd Elixyr <hi>Antiloimicum,</hi> and is of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent uſe.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the univerſal Cure of the Plague, it is requiſite alſo to have a peculiar regard to its incident Symptoms. As for Bubo's, or ſwellings of Glandules, they require the application of attracting, ripening, and cleanſing Ingredients. If they be black and livid, and threaten a Gangrene, they ought to be cut up with a Launce, without waiting for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turation; otherwiſe 'twere proper to endeavour their matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and attract the Poiſon, by applying roaſted Onyons, mix'd with Muſtard-ſeeds; Or in caſe of great Pain, the Juice of Onyons mix'd with <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle and <hi>Soot. Man</hi>'s Ordure, or a Meliſot Plaiſter, mix'd with the Powder of dry'd Toads, and that of Amber, from which Spirit of Wine has been thrice evaporated, are much approv'd for the ſame uſe.

                     <p>Take of crude Antimony, yellow Sulphur and white Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenic, of each two Ounces. Set them in hot Sand in a Phiol 'till they melt and become a dusky Maſs. Then

                     <p>This Plaiſter will raiſe a malignant Cruſt, which ought to be taken off by applying the Ointment of Baſilicon, mix'd with <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle. If the Skin be thick, and the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling lie ſo low that the Plaiſter cannot reach it, let a ſharp bliſtering Plaiſter be firſt applied; or, if that be ineffectual, a Cautery of quick Lime, and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Soap, that ſo the Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter may operat more freely. If it cauſe an Inflammation, let foft'ning Cataplaſms be applied above the Plaiſter, 'till the Cruſt come off. After the ſwelling is open'd, it ought to be cleans'd by the Infuſion of Birth-wort, Myrrh, Aloe, and Saffron in Spirit of Wine Tartaris'd; Or Balſam of <hi>Peru,</hi> and Balſam of Sulphur, mix'd with Treacle; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying <hi>emplaſtrum Album,</hi> mix'd with Oyl of Tobacco. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 'tis ſufficiently cleans'd, apply <hi>Rulandus</hi>'s Plaiſter <hi>Diaſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phuris</hi> for conſolidation. In all Compoſitions relating to peſtilent glandulous Swellings, Mercury, Vinegar, <hi>Opium</hi> and Lead ought to be avoided.</p>
                     <p>Carbuncles are the beginning of a Mortification, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplays it ſelf with a purple Colour, ſurrounded with a red or livid Circumference, incroaching gradually upon the adjacent parts, 'till the mortifi'd part fall off. In order to prevent their ſpreading, let a Circle be drawn round 'em with an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merald ſtone, 'till the part become livid; then touch the point or top with Butter of Antimony; and when the Cruſt appears, apply <hi>Sala</hi>'s Plaiſter, call'd <hi>Magneticum Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenicale.</hi> Some chuſe to open it firſt with an actual Caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and then apply either this Plaiſter, or attracting and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mollient Cataplaſms of Garlic, Water <hi>Germander,</hi> Marſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallows, Meal of Lentils, Berries of the Herb <hi>Paris,</hi> Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon's Dung, Black Soap and Hony; or, in caſe of great pain, the Plaiſter of Hounds Tongue: But, after all, be ſure to avoid fat things. After the Matter is evacuated, apply a Cataplaſm of Comfrey Roots boil'd, or the Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baſilicon, with Balſam of Sulphur and Treacle, or a Cataplaſm of Comfrey Roots boil'd.</p>

                     <p>The ſymptom of Heat is but ſeldom violent in Malignant Feavers, or at leaſt ought not to be much reſtrain'd, for fear of repreſſing the cuticular eruptions.

                     <p>Head-aches, Watchings, and Deliriums are frequently the Companions of peſtilential Feavers.

If the hinder part of the Head be particularly affected, it ſignifies a peculiar diſorder of the Head and Animal Spirits, independent of the Feaver. If the Head-ache ſeize chiefly the fore part, or be attended by anxiety of the Breaſt, and unquietneſs, it proceeds from the Stomac, and ought to be prevented by Vomits, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Clyſters in the beginning of the Diſeaſe.

                  </head>
                  <p>HAving thus diſpatch'd the Diſorders relating to the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation or inteſtin motion of the Blood, we come now in order to conſider thoſe of its circular progreſs. The Blood receiving new Life in the Lungs, throws it ſelf with freſh vigour into the left Ventricle of the Heart, inlarges its Capacity, and diſtends its Fibres. This diſtention or irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Fibres of the Heart, occaſions an unwonted crowd of Spirits, which repair thither from the Brain, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the whole Heart, ſtraiten its Cavity, and impetuouſly ſqueeze out the Blood into the great Artery. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the diſtention of the Artery, caus'd by the eruption of the Blood, ſolicits the Spirits to ſally out, and contract their offended Fibres, and drive the blood forwards, 'till it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at the Veins; thro' which it ſteers an eaſie Courſe to the Heart, moving, without offence or irritation, from nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Paſſages into broader Channels; ſo that the Veins, whoſe Tunicles are ſoft, and not over-touchy, are in no danger of being provok'd to Contractions, by a languid impoveriſh'd Maſs.</p>
                  <p>This ſucceſſive contraction and dilatation of the Heart and Arteries, call'd by the Ancients <hi>Syſtole</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole;</hi> the former occaſion'd by the Spirits repairing to them, and the latter by the violent irruption of Blood, are what we call the Pulſe. This we generally inquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where the Arteries are moſt acceſſible, <hi>viz.</hi> About the Wriſts, Temples, and Ancles, in order to diſcover the ſtate of the Blood. And if we find the Artery much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by turgid Blood, we call it a large Pulſe; if the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:207638:142"/>if the Blood move forcibly and impetuouſly, we term it <hi>ſtrong;</hi> if the Arteries yield to the touch, and do not ſeem to reſiſt or rebound, we ſtile it a <hi>Soft</hi> Pulſe: If the Blood move ſwiftly, the Pulſe is <hi>Frequent;</hi> and if the Heart and Arteries be ſuddenly, and much irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, 'tis <hi>Quick:</hi> Now <hi>Small, Weak, Hard,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequent and flow Pulſes, are the direct reverſe of theſe.</p>
                  <p>Circulation is of uſe to renew the ſtrength of the Blood in the Lungs, and ſupply all the Parts of the Body with Nouriſhment. For 'tis the united Maſs of Blood and Chyle that furniſhes the ſpermatic parts with Chyle or milky imperfect Blood, and thoſe that are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guin with finiſh'd Blood, according to the natural De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the reſpective Parts.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of the Palpitation and trembling of the Heart.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>WHEN the Blood circulats thro' the Heart, it occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions a regular <hi>Syſtole</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole.</hi> But a palpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Heart is a diſorderly convulſive, unequal, vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Contraction, and ſometimes ſcarce perceivable in the Arteries, tho', at other times, exalted to that pitch, that it makes an audible noiſe. A trembling of the Heart is a weak imperfect Contraction.</p>
                     <p>Both are equally owing to the irritation of the Heart, but with this difference, that a palpitation is attended by a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and reſiſting ſtrength, and a trembling by a yielding weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This irritation is ſometimes the effect of the ſharpneſs, or over-bearing quantity of <hi>Serum,</hi> or of Worms in the Heart-purſe; or of little Wheals or Excreſcences within and about the Heart, or great Arteries; ſometimes it proceeds from little Clotts of Blood left by the vicious Maſs in the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:207638:142"/>Heart, or from a provoking <hi>Acid</hi> prevailing in the Maſs of Blood, as it paſſes along or from its irregular and une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual turgeſcence. Upon which account, the ſuppreſſion of the Terms, the <hi>Scurvy</hi> and Hypocondriac Sickneſs are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently follow'd by palpitations of the Heart. Sometimes it takes its riſe from the ſlow and ſtagnating condition of the Blood, and by conſequence, from whatever croſſes or thwarts the circular progreſs. But of all its Cauſes, the moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, is the occaſional diſorder of the Nerves and Animal Spirits, occaſion'd either by Fear, Anger, ſtrong Smells, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or by hyſteric and hypocondriac Paſſions, and the indiſpoſition of the Spleen: For the Nerves of the Heart, and thoſe of the lower Belly, eſpecially of the Spleen, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain a mutual Commerce; by vertue of which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of theſe Nerves is continued to the Heart, and in its progreſs, reſembles the aſcent of Fumes or Steams from the Spleen and Inteſtins. The facility of this communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is much inhanc'd by the ſcorbutic or acid Conſtitution of the Blood, which is equally diſpos'd to provoke both the Nerves of the Heart, and thoſe of the Bowels.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Diagnoſtics.</hi> A palpitation of the Heart is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd by laying one's Hand upon the Breaſt. If it proceed from a <hi>Dropſy</hi> of the <hi>Pericardium,</hi> or Obſtructions in and about the Heart; the Pulſe is ſmall and ſlow, reſpiration diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, and the Body inclining to a Conſumption, and Hectic Feaver. If it proceed from Worms in the Heart-Purſe, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns without manifeſt cauſe, the Breaſt is moleſted with gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, pricking, corroding pains; the Patient is frequently trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bl'd with a pale Countenance, intermitting Pulſe, and a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious unquietneſs, and ſometimes ſudden ſwoonings, or epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leptic Fits. If it take its riſe from the hypocondriac Diſeaſe, it is frequently interrupted; and when it comes, is uſher'd in by a murmuring noiſe in the Belly, or attended by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly Symptoms in the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and a ſenſe of conſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Heart, as if it were ſqueez'd betwixt two Hands. If it flow from a ſcorbutic Original, it does not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade when the Perſon lies quietly in Bed, but upon the leaſt motion of Hand or Foot, diſplays it ſelf, and is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently accompany'd by ſwoonings. A trembling of the Heart is attended by a proſtration of ſtrength, and an une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, weak, languiſhing Pulſe.</p>
                     <pb n="284" facs="tcp:207638:143"/>
                     <p>The Remiſſion or intermiſſion of the Pulſe, following a Palpitation of the Heart, prognoſticates Swoonings. If a Palpitation proceed from a ſcorbutic cauſe, or accompany malignant Symptoms, 'tis very dangerous. If it be occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd by Worms in the <hi>Pericardium,</hi> or Excreſcences in the Heart or adjacent parts, 'tis incurable. If it happen in one's Youth, it prevents Old Age.</p>
                     <p>The Indications for Cure, are to remove the irritating cauſe. <hi>Opium</hi> impairs only the ſenſe of irritation, but has no influence upon the cauſe it ſelf; wherefore it ought to be very cautiouſly us'd, eſpecially, conſidering that a Palpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or trembling is frequently attended by a notable weakneſs. In <hi>hypocondriac,</hi> or <hi>Scorbutic</hi> caſes, perhaps it may not be improper. Blood-letting is alſo dangerous; yet if the ſtagnation of the Blood give riſe to the Diſeaſe, or if the Patient be young, and the Blood boil high, 'tis in ſome meaſure allowable; as when a Palpitation is caus'd by Fear, ſuppreſſing of wonted evacuations, or a violent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of the Body.</p>
                     <p>Of all Palpitations of the Heart, thoſe of a convulſive Character, that ſpring from <hi>Scorbutic,</hi> or <hi>Hypochondriac</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or, in a word, from prevailing <hi>Acid,</hi> are the moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and require a particular regard. Earthy Ingredients, Steel, and volatil Salts, are Medicins moſt in uſe, againſt theſe and all other ſorts of <hi>Palpitations.</hi> The Tincture of Coral, prepar'd with a <hi>Menſtruum</hi> of <hi>May</hi>-Dew, or Snow, and mix'd with ſome cordial Liquor, is an univerſal Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic. Now, of the Cordial Ingredients, Baum is the Head. Its Spirit, or <hi>primum Ens,</hi> or the Eſſence of Amber-griſe extracted with it, is an admirable ſupport for decaying Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Leaves of Baum, and thoſe of Borrage, ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Roſe-water and Vinegar, are applied outwardly to the Heart, with good ſucceſs. Next to Baum are Cloves, Citrons, Orange-peel, Roſemary, Zedoary, Elecampane, Dill, and their various productions. The Eſſence of Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron given inwardly, and a Bag of Saffron and Camphyr hung over the pit of the Breaſt, are of good uſe. The Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Ambergriſe and Moſch, are celebrated Medicins; but Ambergriſe injoys a ſtupifying quality, which may be extinguiſh'd by putting it into fermentation, as in the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Spiritus Roſarum Ambratus.</hi> Beſides, there are ſome ſtudious Men, and hyſteric Women that are eaſily offended by this, and all other oily volatil Salts; in the room of which, we may ſubſtitute the meagre thin Salts, ſuch as
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:207638:143"/>the Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> and dulcifi'd Spirit of Nitre. The Eſſence of Juniper-berries prepar'd with their own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; the carminative ſpirit <hi>de tribus;</hi> the volatil Salt of Vipers; the ſpirit and volatil ſalt of Harts-horn; the ſpirit, volatil Salt, and diſtill'd Oyl of Amber; the Eſſence of Caſtor mix'd with Camphyr, the Oyl of Cinnamon, the Syrup of the filings of Steel, Whey, and all <hi>anti-hypocondriac</hi> Ingredients are much approv'd. Externally, in a <hi>Hyſteric</hi> or <hi>Splenetic</hi> Palpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, we apply the ſame things as are proper againſt the Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>Take of prepar'd red Coral, native Cinnabar, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeat diaphoretic Antimony, half a ſcruple; volatil ſalt of Harts-horn, three grains; diſtill'd Oyl of Cloves, a drop. Make a Powder.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Tincture of Coral prepar'd with the ſpirit of Stags-heart, two drams; the ſpirit of Roſes impregnated with Ambergriſe, a dram. Doſe thirty or ſorty drops in Cinnamon-water.</p>
                     <p>Take of Cinnamon-water impregnated with Quinces, an ounce; the Cordial-water of Saxony an Ounce; Eſſence of Juniper Berries, two drams; Eſſence of Saffron, half an ounce; Spirit of <hi>Venice Treacle</hi> camphoris'd, a dram; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd Oyl of Cinnamon (for Men) or of Amber (for Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) four drops, ſhake and mix them. Doſe a ſpoonful or two.</p>
                     <p>Oft-times not only the Heart, but the Arteries, eſpecially that leading to the Spleen, and that of the Temples, are ſeiz'd with a palpitation. The cauſe is an inflammation of the Place, or ſtagnation of the Blood, or Convulſions of the Spleen and adjacent parts, affecting the Tunicles of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. The firſt two are remov'd by Sudorifics, and the laſt by Steel and <hi>anti-hypochondriac</hi> Medicines.</p>

                     <p>THere are three kinds, or rather degrees of Swooning; <hi>viz. Lipothymia, Syncope,</hi> and <hi>Aſphyxia.</hi> In a <hi>Lipothymia,</hi> beſide that the Pulſe is weaker and leſs, the Senſes both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and external are eclips'd, and animal Motion, both voluntary and natural, does in a manner fail; all which ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms go eaſily off again, and the Patient is reſtor'd to health. In a <hi>Syncope</hi> the ſymptoms are more tragical, the Pulſe, Senſe and bodily Motion are quite extinguiſh'd, Reſpiration is ſcarce perceivable, the Heart is much oppreſs'd, a cold clammy Sweat and Paleneſs covers the Body; and ſometimes the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements come away of their own accord. In an <hi>Aſphyxia</hi> all things are yet worſe; ſo that the Patient lies as one dead, without any Pulſe, or ſign of Life. Now in order to diſcover the cauſe of this diminution of the Pulſe and want of Strength, we muſt call to mind, that the vital force of our Body is founded radically in the Blood, but exerts it ſelf by its moſt ſubtile, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and moveable part, call'd the Spirits; which being vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiliz'd by the inſpired Air in the Breaſt, like Rays of Light, are diffus'd through the whole Body, either in a <hi>vital</hi> Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, together with the Blood in the Arteries, or ſeparately by the Brain and Nerves, under the Character of <hi>animal</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
                     <p>When therefore the Blood, by reaſon of its leſs quantity, or viſcidity and acidity, or want of active Salts, is unfit to undergo the vital Fermentation in the Breaſt, the Spirits muſt of neceſſity fail; whence enſues a weakneſs and languiſhing, that ſteals on by degrees. This vicious conſtitution of the Blood is oftentimes occaſion'd by ſome error in Diet after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Diſeaſes, or follows the indiſcreet management of chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Diſtempers, ſuppoſing the Blood to be rob'd of its Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and the Chyle to be over power'd with Crudities, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the weakneſs of the ſtomachical Ferment and flatneſs of the Bile.</p>

                     <p>But if on a ſudden the vital fermentation of the Blood in the breaſt is interrupted, and by conſequence the luminous Ray of the vital and animal Spirits fail; or if incident external Objects pour diſorder and confuſion on the animal Spirits: then follows a ſudden proſtration of Strength, and ceſſation of Senſe and Motion, which according to its various degrees, is call'd either <hi>Lipothymia, Syncope,</hi> or <hi>Aſphyxia.</hi> Now the vital fermentation of the Blood is interrupted, either by immoderat evacuations of any Humour or Juice ſuch as the Blood, ſeminal Liquor, hydropic Water, corrupt Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or by its coagulation, occaſion'd by Poiſon, or the unfriendly miaſms of corrupt Matter iſſuing froman Impoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hume in the Heart.</p>
                     <p>The external Objects that diſorder the Spirits, are ſuch as excite violent and ſudden paſſions of the Mind, as Frights, Grief, Joy, Anger; alſo ſtrong and diſagreeable Smells, the ſight of Animals to which we have a natural Antipathy, and whatever affects the upper Orifice of the Stomac, which by conſent influences all the other Nerves of the Body: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which occaſions, the Spirits are hindered in their wonted motions, either by oppreſſion or fixation, as in ſudden Frights; or diſſipation, as in exceſſive ſudden Joy; or devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as in Cramps and Convulſions of the Heart.</p>
                     <p>A weakneſs and languiſhing without any manifeſt cauſe, prognoſticats the ſudden invaſion of Diſeaſes, eſpecially thoſe of a Scorbutic Character. If it ſucceed to acute Diſeaſes, it threatens either a Relapſe, Dropſie, or intermitting Feaver. In the beginning of any Diſeaſe, 'tis a ſign of Maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Syncope</hi>'s and <hi>Lipothymi</hi>'s are more or leſs dangerous, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the meaſure of their duration and the character of their ſymptoms; and if after the uſe of ſuitable means the Patient is not awak'd, they prove dangerous: Thoſe occaſion'd by an effuſion of Blood, or other Humours, are ſafer than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that ſpring from an internal acute Cauſe. If they are attended by anguiſh of Heart and reſtleſsneſs, they proceed from the Stomac, and are leſs fatal when the left ſide of the orifice is affected. In fine, the more clammy and copious the cold Sweat is, ſo much the more dangerous is the <hi>Syncope.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Cure is compaſs'd by the continu'd uſe of volatil Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic Medicines, which promote the vital Fermentation, exalt the Blood, ſharpen the unactive Bile, remove the clammineſs of the Blood; and withal, reſtore the digeſtive force of the Stomac. Such are the Spirit of Wine, or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:207638:145"/>Wines, impregnated with vegetable Aromatics; as,</p>
                     <p>Take of Roſemary, curl'd Mint, of each a Handful; Sage and Baum, of each half a handful; Roots of the genuin A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corus, Elecampane and Fennel an Ounce; the four leſſer hot Seeds, of each a Dram; Cinnamon, Cubebs, Cloves, Mace, of each two Drams; cut, bruiſe, and tye them in a Bag, to be infus'd in Wine; of which take a draught in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſting, and at Meals.

                     <p>We may alſo uſe ſtomachical Eſſences and Elixirs, <hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi> aploplectic and epileptic Waters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Volatil oily Salts, and a hundred ſuch like, to be taken thrice a Day, Morning, Noon, and at Bed-time; and alſo before eating.</p>
                     <p>Now as to ſudden fainting and ſwooning, we muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, when the Fit is preſent to remove it, and when 'tis over, to prevent its relapſe.</p>
                     <p>There are three ſorts of Medicins in uſe during the Fit. <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Spirituous, ſulphurous and oily ones; ſuch are all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamable Aromatic Spirits prepar'd by fermentation, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd Aromatic Oyls, and compound apoplectic Waters.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Spirituous <hi>Alcali</hi>'s, ſharp volatil urinous Spirits and Salts, which are always the better for being well charg'd with Oyl.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Sharp volatil Acids, eſpecially Vinegar, which wakens the Senſes, and rallies the diſſipated Spirits. Sometimes we join 'em to <hi>Opiats,</hi> for ſtaying the convulſive motions of the Spirits.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Principal Remedies uſed in a <hi>Syncope,</hi> are Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Wines; Cinnamon, its Water and diſtill'd Oyl, and all its preparations; all Apoplectic Waters; Spirit of <hi>Lilly</hi> of the <hi>Valley</hi> prepar'd by fermentation; ſpirit of <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle, both ſimple and compound; diſtill'd Oyl of Cloves; Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial and <hi>Apoplectic</hi> Balſams; all volatil Salts; ſpirit of Stagg's Heart, ſpirit of Harts-horn prepar'd with Amber; ſpirit of Roſes prepar'd with Amber; to which, if the Salt of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, or that of Amber is added, 'tis almoſt an infallible Remedy.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, the Elixir of Citrons, or their Spirit, ſharpen'd with the volatil ſalt of Harts-horn, the quinteſſences of Baum and <hi>Angelica;</hi> the Eſſence of Saffron mix'd with a grain or two of volatil Salt of Harts-horn; the Tincture of Coral
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:207638:145"/>prepar'd with ſpirit of Stagg's Heart; the Tincture of Gold, the volatil Salts impregnated with diſtill'd aromatic Oyls, ſuch as rectified ſpirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> joined with aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick ſpirit of Wine, are all of excellent uſe, if exhibited in convenient Vehicles, ſuch as Baum-water prepar'd with Wine, Penny-royal and Cinnamon-water; <hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi> or <hi>Matthio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>'s Elixir <hi>vitae,</hi> Water of Stagg's Heart, <hi>Mynſicht</hi>'s hot cordial Water; and for Women, Swallow-water with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to which may be added, Camphyr, or ſpirit of Treacle camphoris'd.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Acids,</hi> we uſe ſpiritous and Generous Wine, the Juice of Citrons, Juice or Syrup of Rasberries, conſerve of the Pulp of Citrons mix'd with Diaſcordium, Vinegar im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with Caſtor, Vinegar of Marigold-flowers, or the Flowers of the Lilly of the Valley, or thoſe of Elder, of Rue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As for <hi>Narcotics, Helmont</hi>'s <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> (in a ſmall Doſe) <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle, <hi>Mithridat,</hi> Extract of Treacle, and ſuch like Compoſitions are proper.</p>
                     <p>In the uſe of theſe Remedies, we muſt have a principal regard to the antecedent Cauſes: For example, if the <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope</hi> is caus'd by poyſon, proper Antidotes muſt be added, and a Vomit exhibited, eſpecially when the Poyſon lurks in the firſt paſſages: When the Cauſe is lodg'd in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac, or Abdomen, Vomits are alſo proper. <hi>Hyſteric</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes require Zedoary, Caſtor, volatil Salts, and other <hi>Hyſteric</hi> Remedies.</p>
                     <p>Externally the ſame Remedies are appli'd to the Noſtrils, Temples, Pulſe, Lips, and pit of the Stomac: The Water of Lilly of the Valley, the Apoplectic Balſam, Oyl of Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and that of Citrons, Oyl of Amber, and Oyl of Cloves are the common Specifics for that uſe; ſome ſay that Fumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation with Amber alone, is of notable efficacy.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Syncope</hi> and <hi>Lipothimia</hi> proceed from unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able evacuations, exceſſive Sweating, Heat, Labour, Fatigue, Anger, Joy, or ungrateful ſmells; let Acids be exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, as alſo a Vomit, if there be occaſion. The Swoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of malignant Feavers are accounted for, by exhibiting Camphyr in a ſmall quantity, mix'd with <hi>Laudanum Opia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> and other Antidots. When they are occaſion'd by frights, exceſſive Bleeding, or immoderat ſadneſs, ſpirituous oily Remedies take place; and if the Paroxiſm is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, a Vein may be open'd: If we fear a <hi>Syncope</hi> from an exceſſive flux of the terms, Opiats join'd with Acids, and prepar'd Coral, are of excellent uſe. For Old
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:207638:146"/>Perſons, there's nothing equals the following Powder, <hi>Viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of Ambergriſe, or Musk, eight grains, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve in twelve drops of Oyl of Cinnamon, and half a Scruple of Oyl of Cardamums; add prepar'd Pearl, half a Scruple; whiteſt Sugar-candy, two ounces. Make a Powder.</p>

                  <p>THE eternal motion of our active Principles, diſturbs the repoſe of the ſolid Parts, unties their Bonds, and expoſes 'em to decay. In order to repair this their loſs, the Blood laden with Chyle, being finiſh'd in the left Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle of the Heart, ſets out from thence, and makes a Tour round the Body; it viſits every Part, and meaſures out ſuitable Recruits, which are ſtrain'd thro' the Pores of the Part, and <hi>nouriſh</hi> it by way of appoſition; or elſe ferment with the Guardian Spirits that defend the Place, and being thereby coagulated, and transform'd into a likeneſs with the Part, conſolidat and give occaſion to its <hi>growth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus all the Members of the Body are either augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Youth, or nouriſh'd and preſerv'd from decay, during the remainder of our lives. Now, the hindrances of a regular Nutrition, are ſuch as relate either to the deficiency or want of due Nouriſhment; or to its redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy, or to its depravation.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of a Conſumption and Phthiſic.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>NUtrition is deficient when the Bones, Cartilages, and Membranes wither; and the Fat and muſcular Fleſh, which are only capable of Conſumption, are accordingly conſum'd. If the Fat alone be melted down, it amounts to no more than a leanneſs; but if the dewy Muſcles are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd without reſtoration, we call it a <hi>Tabes,</hi> or form'd Conſumption.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes of a Conſumption relate either to the Spirits or nutritious Juice. The former are the deficiency or diſſipation of the Spirits; the one caus'd by the vicious Craſis of Blood, or Indiſpoſition of the Brain; the other by Fatigue, Venery, Study, or Grief. Thoſe relating to the nutritious Matter, are firſt its defect, occaſion'd by the ſcarcity or want of proper Food, and conſequently of Chyle; The obſtruction of the <hi>Vaſa la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctea,</hi> the Schirrous Tumors of the <hi>Pylorus,</hi> or thoſe of the <hi>Meſentery,</hi> ſo frequently met with; the compreſſion or wounding of the <hi>Ductus</hi> of the Breaſt; all which cut off the communication of the <hi>Chyle</hi> with the Blood; Worms in the Guts ſucking up the Chyle: Exceſſive evacuations of the nutritious Juice, either in Company with the Blood, in exceſſive Bleedings, or otherwiſe by Looſeneſſes, immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Sweats, runnings of the Reins, Whites, Ulcers, and exceſſive Venery. The ſecond cauſe relating to the Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Juice, is its depravation, occaſion'd either by a weak digeſtion in the Stomac, or the ſaltneſs and viſcidity of the Blood or Lymph, that follows Acute or Intermitting Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, or retains to <hi>Scorbutic,</hi> and <hi>Hypocondriac</hi> Conſtitutions.</p>
                     <p>In fine, the Crudities of the Stomac, and degeneracy of the Blood, are the common cauſes of a Conſumption, and reciprocally promote one another. The former occaſion a ſaline putrid taſte in the Mouth, and provoke the Lungs and Larynx to Cough, as they paſs after joining the Blood. The latter, <hi>viz.</hi> The degeneracy of the Blood, renders it
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:207638:147"/>unfit for nouriſhing the Parts; and is occaſion'd either by the crudity of the Chyle, or the Ulcer of ſome Bowel or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal part that taints it as it paſſes. In which laſt caſe, it procures a Phthiſic.</p>
                     <p>A Phthiſic therefore is generally taken for a Conſumption, ariſing from the Ulcer of any Bowel or external part, as of the Reins, Liver, and eſpecially the Lungs, which are moſt liable to be vitiated by the Air, and the recrements of degenerat Blood. 'Tis diſtinguiſh'd from a <hi>Vomica</hi> of the Lungs by this Mark, <hi>viz.</hi> That the latter is a cloſe Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, inclos'd within its own Membranes, and fill'd with laudable <hi>Pus;</hi> whereas a phthiſical Ulcer is open, and voids ſordid corrupt Matter.</p>
                     <p>Tho' a Phthiſic be generally imputed to an Ulcer of the Lungs, yet it may ariſe from the Corrugation, Schirrus, or any other diſorder of the Lungs or Bowels, that diſturbs and depraves the Blood. Its remote cauſes are: the acrimony and ſaltneſs of the Blood or Lymph, which is frequently ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Crudities from the Stomac; and was repreſented by the Ancients, as a Catarrh or defluxion from the Head; Wounds, Bruiſes, clotted Blood, or heterogeneous Matter in the Breaſt, Inflamations of the Lungs or <hi>Pleura</hi> ending in Suppuration; the Corroſion of the ſmall Pox; corroſive ſteams, as thoſe of <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> Quick-lime, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Drinking of Acid Tartarin Wines or Vinegar; ſmoaking Tobacco, irregular Paſſions of the Mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A <hi>Phthiſic</hi> propagats it ſelf by a hereditary Succeſſion, and is ſo very contagious, that the Breath of a Phthiſical Perſon will corrupt the Lungs of another, and convey its virulency thro' the Breaſts of a ſuckling Woman.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of a Conſumption are theſe, a ſharp Noſe, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Eyes, low Temples, the Laps of the Ears contracted, the Fore-head dry and hard, the Complexion pale and livid, the Ribs and Shoulder-blades bend outward, the Cartilage of the Breaſt is bow'd, the Back-bone ſharp and prominent, the Belly falls low, the Hips are looſe or quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd; the Legs, Arms, Feet, and Hands are dry; the Knuckles protuberant, the Nails bow'd, the Skin wrinkled and flaggy, the Urin is cover'd with Fat, the Veins of the Body are every where apparent, and the Hairs fall off. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturnal Sweats are common to all Phthiſical Perſons; and melting looſeneſſes and ſwellings of the Feet, conclude the Tragedy.</p>
                     <pb n="293" facs="tcp:207638:147"/>
                     <p>If a Conſumption or Phthiſic proceed from an obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Glandules of the <hi>Meſentery,</hi> intercepting the Chyle, the Belly is ſwell'd, and moleſted with a hollow heavy Pain; the region of the Navel is hard, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements are liquid or mix'd with Chyle. If it proceed from a weak digeſtion, or crudities from the Stomac; the Symptoms obſerve this order, <hi>viz.</hi> After much care, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger drinking, or ſome ſuch Error in the uſe of the not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things, there inſues a proſtration of ſtrength and inappe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, eſpecially an averſion to meat; in the Morning an uncooth taſte invades the Mouth, which, by degrees, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſaltiſh, and is attended by a dry tickling Cough; in proceſs of time, the taſte of the Mouth becomes putrid, and reſembles that of Aſhes, or rotten Meat; the dry Cough prevails towards Night, and brings up ſome thin watery Matter; reſpiration is render'd difficult, and the Breaſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd; eſpecially after eating, at which time the whole Body, eſpecially the palms of their Hands are moleſted with Heat. The Pulſe is always quick, frequent, and ſmall. After ſome time, all theſe Symptoms increaſe, the Cough angments, and copiouſly brings up a viſcous white, then yellow, green or livid, and at length a true purulent Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; whereupon Night-ſweats, a Hectic Feaver, and a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual decay inſue. In fine, if a Phthiſic of the Lungs be not externally occaſion'd, or depend not upon a preceding Diſeaſe, ſuch as a Pleuriſie, or ſpitting of Blood, it always flows from the Stomac.</p>
                     <p>From this Induction, we may infer, that in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a Phthiſic, the Cough does not always proceed from the Lungs, but from the Stomac: Nay, ſometimes tho' the Lungs be ulcerated, if the Matter do not irritate the <hi>Bronchia,</hi> there inſues no Cough at all. Beſides, the Matter which is expectorated by coughing, is not always bred in the Lungs, as being ſometimes taken up from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ulcerated Parts by the Blood. In which caſe, 'tis a difficult matter to trace out the part to which the Ulcer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs. But in general, if it lodge in the Abdomen, the Symptoms of the Belly do diſcover it. If the Cough bring up no purulent Matter, we conclude that the Phthiſic is owing to a Schirrus, or ſome ſuch diſorder among the <hi>Viſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra.</hi> Now the purulency of this Matter is diſcover'd by its ſinking in Water, whereas that which is only viſcid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing porous and dilated with Air, ſwims above. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, if the Lungs are exulcerated, the Cough ſounds
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:207638:148"/>hollow and deep; and if they be much conſum'd, are void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by pieces. If the right ſide be chiefly affected, the ſick Perſon cannot lie but on the right ſide, and <hi>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>A confirm'd Phthiſic or Conſumption is incurable; while 'tis yet but growing, there are ſome hopes; eſpecially, if the Stomac is not much diſorder'd. If it proceed from hard ſwellings in the Lungs, Schirrus's or Ulcers in the Bowels, from the Scurvy, the Whites, Dropſy, or running of the Reins, 'tis ſeldom cur'd. If the Cough diſappear of a ſudden, 'tis a tragical Omen; as alſo if the Hairs fall off, and the feet ſwell, or if the expectorated Matter ſtink when thrown upon burning Coals.</p>
                     <p>The Cure is compaſſed by removing the various Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; mitigating the Symptoms, and projecting a method for nouriſhing the Body. For which end let the following Cautions be heedfully minded.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There's no Remedy whatſoever that equals Vomits, eſpecially in the beginning, nor any caſe in which they are nor convenient, except that of a ſpitting of Blood, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Weakneſs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Purgation, Bleeding, and iſſues are of no uſe. The firſt is pernicious, and augments the Cough; or if in the beginning of a Phthiſic, it be abſolutely neceſſary to cleanſe the firſt Paſſages, Rhubarb is the moſt proper Ingredient; the ſecond is never allowable, unleſs a ſuppreſſion of Blood require it; the third was introduc'd of old, in compliance with the exploded Fancy of a Phthiſic's being caus'd by a Catarrh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> diſtilling from the Brain, which now we juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to the Stomac.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Sugar, Hony, and all ſweet Syrups are hurtful. They putrify in the Stomac, weaken its digeſtion, and pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ore the corroſion of the affected Bowel.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. A ſcorbutic Conſumption is admirably accounted for by a Milk Dyet, eſpecially that of Goats Milk, mix'd with vulnerary and <hi>anti-ſcorbutic</hi> Syrups.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Tho' an inveterat Phthiſic do not admit of a perfect Cure, yet the Life may be drill'd on by a Milk Diet, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vulnerary Medicines, and changing the Air.</p>
                     <p>Milk is a Sovereign Remedy, when the Diſeaſe proceeds from a ſharpneſs of the Blood or Lymph; it both cleanſes with its Whey, and heals with its Butter. Indeed if it ſpring from the corruption of a Bowel, or default of the Stomac, 'tis improper, as being apt to curdle and putrify in a deprav'd Stomac. Goats Milk, mix'd with the Spirit of
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:207638:148"/>Scurvy-graſs, or that of <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> is of excellent Uſe in Scorbutic caſes; but Woman's Milk ſuck'd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from the Breaſts, without being expoſed to the Air, and the Butter made of it, are preferable to any other. It will not be amiſs to add a little Sugar, or Conſerve of Roſes to prevent Curdling. And when Perſons are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to a Milk Diet, they ought to take of it three or four times a Day, and uſe ſome exerciſe after taking it, in order to promote its quick diſtribution; and, in the interim, eat nothing elſe but Raiſins, or Food of very eaſie digeſtion. Note, before the uſe of Milk, 'tis adviſable to exhibit a Vomit.</p>
                     <p>The Yelks of Eggs diſſolv'd in Wine, and mix'd with a little Amber-griſe, are of admirable uſe in Venereal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions.</p>
                     <p>The Decoctions of Elecampane-roots, with Raiſins and Liquorice, and a little <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wine, are of noted effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy againſt all Phthiſics; to which we may add, Sweet Almonds, and Emulſions of Milky Seeds, Oyſters, River-Crabbs mix'd with Butter, Cockles, and all temperat Ingredients. In the beginning of the Diſeaſe, eſpecially when it proceeds from the Stomac, Acids, ſuch as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Salt, <hi>Nitrum Antimoniatum, Terra foliata Tartari,</hi> diſtill'd Vinegar with Crabs-Eyes diſſolv'd in it; <hi>Sal-Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac, &amp;c.</hi> are recommended upon the acount of their Stoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical Virtue. But, after the confirmation of the Diſeaſe, or an Ulcer in the Lungs, both theſe, and all Spaw-Waters ought to be equally avoided. And as for the ſharpneſs of the Blood and Lymph, which vitiats the Lungs, and is generally the Cauſe of thoſe Phthiſics that the Ancients refer to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrhs from the Head; Sulphur is a proper Remedy. It contains both Acid and Balmy Parts; the former are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, and ought to be carefully ſeparated from the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Thus, the Flowers of Sulphur nicely prepar'd, and the Balſam of Sulphur prepar'd with diſtill'd Oyl of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeds, are incomparable Medicines. If a Hectic and Night-Sweats prevail, perhaps the Balſam of Sulphur prepar'd with diſtill'd Oyls, may prove too hot; in which caſe let it be prepar'd with the Oyl of Sweet-Almonds, adding but a few drops of diſtill'd Oyl of Aniſeed, which laſt alone is a noble Pectoral. Or the heat of the Balſam may be reſtrain'd, by adding the Sugar of Lead, or the Anti-phthiſical Tincture of two Parts of Vitriol of Steel, and one of Sugar of Lead infus'd in rectifi'd Spirit of
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:207638:149"/>Wine, or the dewy Phlegm of Vitriol, that's free of Acidity, rectifi'd upon its own <hi>Caput mortuum.</hi> The Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Blood-ſtone, or that of the Sulphur of Vitriol, are alſo fir to be added.</p>
                     <p>In the room of Common Sulphur, ſome chuſe the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral fix'd Sulphurs, ſuch as Diaphoretic Antimony; <hi>Pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>'s Antihectic, and all preparations from Antimony fix'd with Tin and Steel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To theſe we join other Balmy Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, <hi>viz.</hi> Amber, Aloes, Myrrh, eſpecially when the Phthiſic is not far advanc'd, nor the Hectic very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; Together with the pectoral ſpecifics, <hi>viz.</hi> Traga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canth, Elecampane Roots, Sperma Ceti (given to half a dram in a Potch'd Egg) Orris Roots, the Conſerve of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Bole-armenic, ſeal'd Earth, Blood-ſtone, and the Muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room of a Willow (given to half a dram in the Conſerve of Ground Ivy) all which are very uſeful for tempering the acrimony of the Blood and Chyle. But before we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence the uſe of Specifics, a Vomit ought to be exhibited, for cleanſing the firſt Paſſages.</p>
                     <p>The Decoctions of Woods, eſpecially China and Saſſafras together with Elecampane, Liquorice, Raiſins, and Vulnera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ingredients, are of ſingular efficacy in this Caſe. Their Roſinous Sulphureous ſubſtance is at once qualify'd for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering the ſharpneſs of the Humors, evacuating the corrupt Matter, and cleanſing the Ulcer. But whoever would reap benefit by theſe Decoctions, muſt reſolve to Drink nothing elſe.</p>
                     <p>Narcotics, eſpecially the Pills of Storax are of good uſe for promoting the Maturation and Concoction of the matter in the Lungs, curbing the dry Night Coughs, and preventing Night-ſweats. Phthiſical Perſons admit of large Doſes, and perſiſt long in the uſe of 'em without detriment. Towards the height of the Diſeaſe, when Reſpiration is difficult and a great deal of Viſcous matter lyes ready for expectoration, 'tis conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to diſcontinue their uſe.</p>
                     <p>In regard of the ulcerated Bowel, the vulnerary Specifics, and the baling Ingredients above-mention'd, are calculated for its relief. Ground Ivy, Chervil, Scabious and male Speedwel, eſpecially the firſt, or its Juice, ought never to be omitted. Some commend <hi>Indian</hi> Creſſes and Roſaſolis. In Scorbutic Caſes 'tis proper to add Antiſcorbutic Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients.</p>
                     <p>If the Hectic do not Prohibit the uſe of Balſams, we may add the Balſam of Sulphur, Balſam of <hi>Peru,</hi> Turpentin diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd with the yelk of an Egg, Myrrh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="297" facs="tcp:207638:149"/>
                     <p>Some recommend the Decoction of Penny-Royal. Others the volatil Salt of Harts-horn and its Spirit tinctur'd with Balſam of Sulphur, the Spirit of Ants, the Spirit and volatil Salt of Man's Urine, and the like; but if the Diſeaſe be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterat, and the Lungs ulcerated, they are very improper. Perhaps after chronical Diſeaſes, or when the Chyle is not diſtributed thro' the Body, they may be of ſome uſe.</p>
                     <p>The dry tickling Cough and Night-ſweats, that uſually moleſt Phthiſical Perſons, are abated by incraſſating Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, mix'd with Opiats. But Treacle and hot Compoſitions ought to be avoided.</p>
                     <p>For cleanſing the Ulcer in the Lungs, and bringing up the viſcous Matter, the Syrup of Tobacco ought to be mix'd with the other expectorating Ingredients. And if the Matter ſtink, or if the Perſon ſpit very much, let Myrrh and Hony be always added. But if a Feaver or melting Looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs accompany a Phthiſic, let Hony be avoided, and abſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent earthy Powders exhibited.</p>
                     <p>The Food of Phthiſical Perſons ought to be ſuch as yields a ſubſtantial glutinous Juice, ſuch as Eggs, Raiſins, Oyſters, River Crabs, and Milk. They ought to avoid drinking much, and what they Drink may be impregnated with Fumes of Sulphur. Of Wines the ſweeteſt are the beſt. As for Air; thoſe that are emaciated and wither'd, require a thick Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Air; whereas thoſe that are otherwiſe find their account in breathing in a clear dry Air.</p>

                     <p>Take of Plumous Allum, and melted Salt, of each equal Quantities, melt 'em over a ſtrong Fire.

                     <p>IF the nutritious Juice be too copiouſly diſtributed thro' the Body the Muſcles and Joints are extended, and for want of room are diſabled to recoyl and contract themſelves with due nimbleneſs, and the Belly being over-charg'd with Fat and Juice, inlarges its Dimenſions. So that the true Cauſe of Corpulency or fatneſs is the temperat ſoftneſs of the Blood, the leſs Conſumption of the Nutritious Juice, by reaſon of a ſlow Fermentation, and the late aſſimilation of the Chyle in company of the Blood, giving it opportunity to be coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and appropriated, by the peculiar acid Spirits that guard the reſpective Parts.</p>
                     <p>The remote Cauſes of fatneſs are abſtinence from Drink, eſpecially Hop'd Beer, or Ale made of Malt; or whatever dilutes the Nutritious Juice, and conſequently promotes its exhalation; drinking moderatly Ale made of Corn, which has a peculiar fattening Vertue; eating much Bread, which promotes the Fermentation and Digeſtion of Food; much ſleep, freedom from Care, Exerciſe, and Venery.</p>
                     <pb n="301" facs="tcp:207638:151"/>
                     <p>Corpulency ſqueezes the Spermatic Veſſels, and cauſes Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs, nay it oppreſſes all the Veſſels in the Body, retards the Motion of the Blood, anticipats the matter that ſhould be converted into Spirits, cramps all muſcular Motions, and accelerats Death.</p>
                     <p>The Cure is compaſs'd by preventing the immoderat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Chyle, or evacuating it before its Aſſimilation to the Part, or melting and diluting it with Serum after its appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation. The firſt deſign is anſwer'd by a ſpare thin Diet, and eating of ſalt Meat. The ſecond and third by Purgation with <hi>Extractum Catholicum,</hi> and ſweet Mercury repeated till it ſalivat; or the Pills of Aloes, and Elixyr Proprietatis, which was known among the Ancients for a drying Medicine. Now that which they call'd <hi>Drying,</hi> is nothing but the melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of the Nutritious Juice. Hence Myrrh, Gentian, Wormwood, Creſſes, and all Diuretic or Diaphoretic In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients are of uſe, by reaſon of their attenuating reſolving Quality. But Vinegar of Squills, Tartar, Tartar Vitriolated, Nitre, and all Acids, are intitled to a preference. Bleeding, Iſſues, chewing Medicines, the Decoctions of <hi>Woods,</hi> Venery, and in a Word whatever attenuats the Nutritious Juice, and dilutes it with a ſerous Vehicle in order to evacuation, either by Urine, Sweat, or otherwiſe, is recommended againſt Fatneſs. Only this Caution ought to be taken notice of, that ſudden and liberal Evacuations are apt to weaken fat People. To Conclude, I ſubjoyn a <hi>Recipe</hi> for Pills that are much approv'd.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Gum of the Juniper Tree, two drams; Choice Myrrh, Shavings of <hi>Lignum Sanctum,</hi> extract of Wormwood and Aloe, of each a Scruple, Coagulated Spirit of Vitriol, half a dram. Make Pills.</p>

                        <head>ART. 1. <hi>Of a Cachexy, Leucophlegmacy and Anaſarca.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>IF the Chyle or Nutritious Juice is not duly digeſted and aſſimilated to the Blood, it Tinctures it with a pituitous Crudity, Stifles its ſaline particles, and cramps its due tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſcence; whereupon the Skin is diſcolour'd, and the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles inſtead of receiving elaborat nouriſhment, are ſtuff'd and bloated up with crude matter, and ſo render'd flaccid: This we call a <hi>Leucophlegmacy.</hi> And if this crude vicious Juice obſtruct the Glandules of the Muſcles, or if the Lymph be upon any account oblig'd to Stagnat, the Blood becomes ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and a Collection of Serum or Water lodg'd under the Skin cauſes an <hi>Anaſarca.</hi> Now a Cachexy is a general Term importing the Crudity of the maſs of Blood, and its weaker Fermentation, which give riſe to theſe two Diſeaſes. The remote Cauſes are want of motion, care, grief, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Terms, chronical Diſeaſes, ſuppreſſion of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, the French Pox; and in a word, whatever weakens Digeſtion, and ſtifles the Fermentation of the Blood.</p>
                        <p>The Symptoms obſerve the following Method. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chectic Perſon grows Pale, and in ſome meaſure Livid; his Face, and in proceſs of time, the whole ſurface of the Body is ſwollen; upon any quick motion or walking up an aſcent he is troubled with a ſhortneſs of breath, and palpitation of the Heart and temporal Arteries; an univerſal Wearineſs ſeizes the Joints, and after eating, Anxiety and a ſenſe of Compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion oft-times invades the Breaſt; the Appetit, which at firſt is good, decays by degrees, the Pulſe is unequal, ſmall, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:207638:152"/>and weak; the Urine crude, pale, and watery; and towards the height of the Diſeaſe becomes thick, and depoſits a white Sediment; and finally the Perſon is ſeiz'd with a ſlow Feaver, ſcarce perceivable by himſelf, and is oft-times thirſty and coſtive.</p>
                        <p>Thus far the Diſeaſe is only denominated a <hi>Cachexy.</hi> But afterwards the whole Body becomes very turgid, eſpecially the Feet and Belly, the Skin thick and pale, and when preſs'd by one's Finger receives durable Pits, which intitle it to the Character of a <hi>Leucophlegmacy:</hi> Whereas an <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarca</hi> requires that theſe Pits ſhould quickly diſappear, and that a ſhining Colour cover the ſwelling.</p>
                        <p>Cachexies are apt to invade Women, or thoſe who confine themſelves to a ſedentary Life; and if the Woman be paſt the ſeaſon of her Terms, they prove very tedious: If they ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to acute or intermitting Feavers, or miſmanag'd chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Diſeaſes, they are not eaſily cur'd.</p>
                        <p>The Cure conſiſts in attenuating, correcting, and evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Crudities of the firſt Paſſages, whetting the Bile, vanquiſhing the vicious acid, and ſtrengthning the Stomac. For theſe Ends we ought to be cautious of giving ſtrong Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives, or forcing the Cure too violently. The better way is to proceed by degrees, firſt to prepare the Crudities of the firſt Paſſages by digeſtive Salts, ſuch as the Hypochondriac digeſtive Salt, given to half a dram twice a day, Tartar vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triolated, <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> and the Tincture of Tartar; mix'd with abſorbent Powders, <hi>viz.</hi> Coral, ſeal'd Earth, <hi>Bezoar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicum martiale,</hi> and <hi>Poterius</hi>'s Antihectic (made of the <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> of Antimony, Tin and Nitre.) Then to exhibit a Vomit, ſuch as the Conſerve of Hedge-Hyſſop, given from a dram to two drams; or the Decoction of Hedge-Hyſſop in Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or if a Vomit be improper, to order a gentle Purge of the Extract of <hi>Eſula,</hi> or Juice of common Orris, mix'd with ſweet Mercury, and Preparations from Gum Ammoniac.</p>
                        <p>The firſt Paſſages being thus cleans'd, we advance to Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeats, which ought to be continu'd for ſeveral Weeks, a gentle Laxative being interlac'd every Week, and the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent remembring always to ſtir and move after taking 'em. If the peccant Acid be very rank, and the Stomac ſtrong, we may give the filings of Steel, in Subſtance, or the natural and artificial Waters; otherwiſe chalybear Rheniſh Wine, impregnated with Aromatic Herbs, or rather the Extract of Steel prepar'd with Juice of Apples, or that aſcrib'd to <hi>Myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſichtius,</hi>
                           <pb n="304" facs="tcp:207638:153"/>or the Tincture of the Vitriol of Steel, and <hi>Bezoar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicum Martiale,</hi> will anſwer the Deſign.</p>
                        <p>After the uſe of Steel is the proper Seaſon for exhibiting the Infuſions or Decoctions of the ſharp, bitter Aromatic Herbs and Spices, to which we add ſome gentle Laxative, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rhubarb, which retrieves the Choler, and ſubdues the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid. The Ingredients of this Nature are Wormwood, Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, Turmeric, leſſer Centory, <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campane and Cuckow-pint Roots; Roſemary, Hyſſop, Mint, Horſe-Radiſhes, Creſſes, Scurvy-graſs, Cinnamon, Galan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, Zedoary, Cloves, Ginger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Rob of Juniper, and Pulp of Raiſins are much approv'd for the ſame effect; and if we add to them Extract of Steel, they prove more effectual. And after all, towards the end of the Cure, we order the Patient to take every Morning and Evening ſome drops of volatil ſaline Spirits, till he become perfectly well; ſuch are the Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> or <hi>Elixyr Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis</hi> prepar'd with it, the Eſſence of Wormwood, the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minative Spirit <hi>de tribus,</hi> the Nephritic Tincture, the Spirit of Harts-horn ſuccinated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In a perfect <hi>Anaſarca</hi> the ſame Remedies are convenient. To which we may add the Lye made of Wine, and the Aſhes of Wormwood and Broom; ſudorific Decoctions of Woods and Juniper Berries, and that of Swallow-wort, and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campane; the Seed of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Wort given to a dram in Wine, or diuretic Infuſions and Decoctions of <hi>Aſarabecca,</hi> Briony, red Chiches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> mix'd with <hi>Emmenagoga</hi> in a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Terms, (which frequently follows a Cachexy or Anaſarca.) In ſcorbutic caſes, let Earth-Worms be added to the Aromatic Decoctions.</p>
                        <p>Externally Burdock Leaves bruis'd, and applied to the Joynts and ſoles of the Feet, are very uſeful. The natural ſulphureous Baths are of known Efficacy; as alſo the dry Bagnios; or in the beginning and declination of the Diſeaſe, the way of procuring Sweat by kindling Spirit of Wine. Some order the cachectic Body to be put into hot Sand. As for the Forms of preſcribing, they are as follows.</p>
                        <p>Take of Tartar vitriolated, two ſcruples; ſalt of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, and prepar'd Crabs Eyes, of each a Scruple; diſtill'd Oyl of Turpentin, ſix drops. Make a digeſtive Powder for three Doſes, to be exhibited before vomiting.</p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Quercetanus</hi>'s Pills of Ammoniac and ſweet Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, of each fifteen grains; Extract of Troches Alhandal, a
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:207638:153"/>grain and a half. Make Pills for a gentle Purge. 'Tis alſo very proper to add the Extract of Steel to all purging Pills.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Filings of Steel, one part; Cinnamon in Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, two parts; Sugar, three parts. Make a chalybeat Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Doſe a dram.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Pulp of Raiſins, ſix ounces; Extract of Steel prepar'd with Juice of Apples, three ounces; choice Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb, three drams; with the Syrup of Apples make an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary. The ſolar Liquor of Steel may alſo be taken from twelve to thirty drops; or the ſolution of Steel in Juice of Apples mix'd with ſpirit of Scurvy-graſs, to fifty drops.</p>
                        <p>Take of Fumitory, Worm-wood, and Roſemary, of each a handful; Elecampane, and Fennel roots, of each ſix drams; pick'd Senna, an ounce; black Hellebor roots, ſix drams; choice Rhubarb, three drams; the four greater hot Seeds, of each a dram and a half; Orange and Citron Peel, of each three drams; Galangal and Ginger, of each a dram; ſalt of Tartar, two drams. Make a Bag to be infus'd in Wine, of which let the Patient take a draught twice or thrice a day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having finiſh'd the courſe of Steel.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Species <hi>Diacurcumae,</hi> four ſcruples; choice Rhubarb, two drams; Powder <hi>Diarrhodon, Abbatis,</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agalangae,</hi> of each a ſcruple; with Syrup of Worm-wood make Pills. Doſe a dram.</p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Elixyr Proprietatis</hi> without the acid, an ounce; Eſſence of Wormwood, and that of leſſer Centory, of each two Drams. Mix them to be us'd in the Declination of the Diſeaſe, to fifty drops every Morning in a warm Vehicle; and follow'd by fifty drops of Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi> mix'd with double its quantity of the carminative Spirit <hi>de tribus,</hi> taken after dinner, and at bed time.</p>

                        <head>ART. 2. <hi>Of an univerſal Dropſie.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>A Dropſie is a Collection and Extravaſation of <hi>Serum,</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Diſtention, Tumor, and Softneſs in the external parts. Sometimes a viſcous Humor accompanies the Serum, and then 'tis a ſpurious ſort of Dropſie, complicated with an
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:207638:154"/>
                           <hi>Anaſarca.</hi> A Tympany goes generally by the name of a Dropſie, but for ſo much as it proceeds from Wind, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to the Chapter of Wind in the Stomac. A Dropſie is call'd univerſal, when it proceeds from the general Infirmity of the Body. A particular Dropſie is owing to the infirmity of that Part from which it receives its Denomination. The moſt common ſort of Dropſie is that call'd <hi>Aſcites,</hi> which begins at the Feet, and in a ſhort time reaches the Belly and Scrotum.</p>
                        <p>This Serum, whoſe Extravaſation cauſes a Dropſie, for the moſt part is depoſited into the reſpective Cavities, by the Blood circulating in the Arteries. 'Tis true the Rupture and Obſtruction of the lymphatic and milky Veſſels, may cauſe a Stagnation or Extravaſation: but that happens by accident. Whereas the ſtanding and direct ſource of Dropſies is the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Craſis of the Blood, as being unqualified for digeſting and aſſimilating its Serum; and its languid Motion, giving the Serum an opportunity of ſqueezing through the Veſſels, eſpecially about the Capillary Arteries, where the influence of the Heart (the <hi>primum mobile</hi>) is but very ſmall, and more eaſily communicable to the thick reſiſting Blood, than to the weak yielding Serum. Now that the ſlow motion of the Blood will occaſion a Tranſmiſſion of the Serum, is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made out by Dr. <hi>Louer</hi>'s Experiment of tying a Ligature about the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> under the Heart; and that the vicious Craſis or Crudity of the Blood occaſions an imperfect Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſcence, and a weak Propulſion from the Heart, is too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to need a proof. I grant that there are ſome melting Dropſies that proceed from the Colliquation of the Humours originally contain'd in the part, without the aſſiſtance of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Serum, as in Hectic Feavers, and after hot acute Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; but theſe are not proper Dropſies, as being only Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms of a Colliquation.</p>
                        <p>According to this Hypotheſis, we need not be at a loſs to ſcan the Influence of remote Cauſes. 'Tis an obvious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, that whatever weakens Digeſtion, accumulats Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, enfeebles the natural Functions, and, in a word, all Chachectic Diſorders are apt to degenerat into Dropſies. The ſuppreſſion of Urine and that of inſenſible tranſpiration, are either the Cauſes or inſeparable Companions of a Dropſie. Nay, I doubt much if an univerſal <hi>Aſcites</hi> can ever take place, unleſs the Kidneys be diſorder'd. And 'tis a notorious obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to this purpoſe, that whoever drinks much, and does not piſs proportionably, may juſtly make account to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Dropſie e're he dies; and that whoever attempts the
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:207638:154"/>Cure of a Dropſie without <hi>Diuretic</hi> Medicines, is but lamely equip'd for his Office. The drinking of Brandy and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Liquors that melt down the Humors, ſharpen the Lymph, and relaxat the Stomac; the inconſiderat uſe of cold Water, immediatly after violent Heat; the ſuppreſſion of any wonted Evacuation, and exceſs of any Flux, whether of Blood or other Humors; the attenuation of the Serum, by the uſe of Mercury; the Jaundice, and inactivity of the Bile; Chronical Agues miſmanag'd; Aſthma's, Phthiſics, and Spitting of Blood, and in fine, whatever weakens Nature, renders the Blood uncapable to aſſimilat the Chyle, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tards its circular Motion, and diſturbs its due Targeſcence: theſe I ſay, are the natural Authors of a Dtopſie. The tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of the Meſentery, Liver, and other Bowels do generally accompany this Diſeaſe, but oft-times are rather effects than Cauſes.</p>
                        <p>The Symptoms of a Dropſie diſplay themſelves after this method: The Feet at firſt begin to ſwell, and receive Pits by the preſſing of one's Finger; in the Night time the ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abates, but regains new force the ſucceeding Day. By degrees it reaches to the Abdomen, and Scrotum, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently affects the Prepuce and Teſticles. The Water thus inclos'd in the Belly ſometimes poſſeſſes one ſide, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times both, and as the Perſon turns in his Bed it rolls, with a noiſe, and ſometimes viſibly, from one ſide to the other; in the mean while the Breaſt, Neck, and upper Parts waſte and decay. The Face and Hands ſometimes ſwell. An itching, and oft-times a ſcab, moleſts the Skin; and ſpots or wheals beſet the Legs. A ſlow Feaver purſues him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes towards the Evening. The Pulſe is ſmall, frequent, and a little hard. An unquenchable Thirſt, loſs of Appetit, ſtraitneſs of the Breaſt, ſhortneſs of Breath, eſpecially in the Night time, and a dry Cough oft-times uſher in a Dropſie.</p>
                        <p>Big belly'd Women are oft-times apt to ſuſpect a Dropſie without occaſion. The ſigns which ſerve to undeceive 'em are theſe. In a Dropſie the Face is pale and Livid, the Eyes are rob'd of their ſparkling Vigor, the Water contain'd in the Belly Floats to and again, falls as the Woman turns her ſelf, and is very weighty. The ſwelling is ſoft, equal, and bends downward; it do's not impair the Flux of the Terms, but diminiſhes the quantity of Urine, and gives it a high Tincture, and cauſes a violent Thirſt; all which Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms are contrary to thoſe of Being with Child.</p>
                        <pb n="308" facs="tcp:207638:155"/>

                           </gap>ic Water is not always of the ſame Colour, as being either Green, Yellow, or Blackiſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But 'tis ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſalin and ſharp, apt to corrode the Bowels, and to cauſe Ulcers on the Legs, or to caſt a Froth like Lather, when mix'd with other Water; nay the diſtention and ſtiffneſs of the Membrans inwrapping it ſeems to argue that it ferments within, and provokes them to Contractions.</p>
                        <p>As for Prognoſtics. If a Dropſie follow Chronical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, or indiſcreet Purgation, or invade thoſe whoſe ſtrength is decay'd; if it be attended by unſpeakable Thirſt, Cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Schirrus of the Bowels, difficult Reſpiration, ſcarcity and redneſs of Urine, hardneſs of the Belly, extreme inappetency, or a melting Feaver, Ulcers or livid Spots in the Legs, Black Excrements (when the Perſon do's not uſe Steel) Theſe I ſay are diſmal Circumſtances, whereas the Reverſe of 'em are look'd upon as hopeful Signs. Convulſions and Apoplexies ſucceeding a Dropſie are very fatal.</p>
                        <p>The Cure turns upon two indications. 1. To remove the ſtagnating Serum. 2. To prevent its further increaſe by retrieving the due Craſis of the Blood, and fortifying the Stomac, in order to a regular Chylification.</p>
                        <p>The firſt is anſwer'd by Evacuations, and abſtaining from Drink.</p>
                        <p>Of evacuating Medicines, Purgatives are the firſt, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Roots of the Common Flower-de-luce, and <hi>Elaterium,</hi> or the Juice of the wild Cucumber. The former do's not only evacuat but enjoys alſo an alterative Vertue; and is given to three drams in Infuſion, or its Juice expreſs'd, to half an ounce, with a ſcruple of the Powder of Soldanella. Elaterium, or its Extract prepar'd with Spirit of Wine Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taris'd, given to fifteen grains, is fitly joyn'd with ſweet Mercury. The Infuſion or Decoction of half an ounce of Bryony, with Salt of Tartar, is of excellent uſe againſt Dropſies of the Womb. When the Serum is mix'd with viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous Humors, Coloquintida, or the extract of Troches Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handal ought to be added. The lunar Pills made of the Cryſtals of well refin'd Silver, prepar'd with Spirit of Nitre or Aquafortis; or <hi>Mercurius Vitae</hi> render'd Laxative, by mixing it with ſweet Mercury, are alſo noted Purges againſt Dropſies. To which we may add the Roſin of Jalap, the Infuſion of a handful of the Flowers of <hi>Acacia</hi> in Whey, the Syrup and Conſerve of Peach Flowers; Gutta Gamba, given in Powder to ſixteen grains, or its Roſin given to twelve grains; the Infuſion of two or three drams of Hedge-Hyſſop,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:207638:155"/>or its Conſerve given to two drams, Syrup of Buckthorn, and the Rinds or Leaves of Elder. The proper ſeaſon for exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting Purges to Hydropic Perſons is immediatly before the new Moon, when the Diſeaſe of it ſelf relents; But if the Hydropic Water lodge in the Purſe of the Caul, or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicat of the Peritonaeum, or Veſicles of the Meſentery, and not in the Cavities of the Womb, Purgation is of no uſe: And withal we ought to remark that Purgatives ought to be mix'd with Stomachical Specifics, eſpecially Wormwood; and not too often repeated, by reaſon that they melt down the laudable Humors as well as the bad, and ſo indirectly ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the Diſeaſe; eſpecially if they do not operat quickly after Adminiſtration.</p>
                        <p>If the Hydropic Perſon Vomit eaſily, or be moleſted with a ſhortneſs of Breath, Vomits are uſeful. But they ought to be given in large Doſes, otherwiſe they do not Operate. Opiats in general are pernicious, tho' in ſome ſingular Inſtances they may pacify the Spirits, appeaſe the irritated Fibres of the Kidneys, and ſo indirectly promote an Evacuation by U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Diuretics</hi> are the choiceſt evacuating Remedies. But they ought not to be exhibited till after the uſe of Laxative, atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating and opening Ingredients, nor us'd without the addition of Chalybeat or Corroborating Medicines. Aſarum, Wormwood, Elecampane, and Gentian lead the Van. The Juice or Infuſion of Celandin the greater, is a celebrated Specific; to which we may add the Decoction of Swallow-wort in Wine or its Extract, it being peculiarly calculated for ſuch Dropſies as proceed from Scrophulous tumors in the Meſentery. Hore-hound is much recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended againſt a Hydropical Jaundice. The Infuſion, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, or Juice of Garlic is a powerful Diuretic, as alſo Turmerick and Madder. The Decoction, Infuſion, Spirit and Rob of Juniper Wood and Berries are of excellent uſe, and ſeem to claim a Preference before the Decoctions of Guajacum and Saſſafras. The Juice of the Herb <hi>Kali</hi> given to half a dram is much applauded, but it ought not to be taken above three Days in a Week, for fear of over do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                        <p>In thoſe Dropſies which approach to <hi>Anaſarca</hi>'s, fix'd Salts are of good uſe, and perhaps preferable to other Diure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics. But in an <hi>Aſcites</hi> 'tis not improper to ſhift 'em, for thoſe of a volatil nitrous Character. The Heads of the fix'd ſort are the Lixivious Salts of Vine-Twigs, Bean-ſtalks,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:207638:156"/>Juniper and Lime-tree-wood. The volatil, are all the volatil preparations of Tartar, the Spirit and Flowers of <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> or <hi>Elixyr Propritatis</hi> prepar'd with it, and the volatil Salt of Harts-horn; <hi>Poppius</hi> beſtows large Encomiums on the Spirit of Urine, rectify'd with Spirit of Wine Amber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griſe and Moſch, and given to half a dram, Morning and Evening; nay, Man's Urine, or that of Sheep is very ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual among poor People. <hi>Crollius</hi> recommends Gooſe-Dung given to a dram in diſtill'd Urine.</p>
                        <p>The Spirit of putrifi'd Earth-worms, given to ſixty drops, twice or thrice a day in Wine impregnated with Juniper Berries; or the Liquor that flows, <hi>per deliquium,</hi> from Earth-Worms putrifi'd with Moſs of Earth, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with Dough in an Oven, given to a ſpoonful twice a day; the Powder of dry'd Toads, the Heads and Guts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thrown away, given to a Scruple three or four times in one Day, but ſo as to intermit three or four days before it be us'd again; the Liquor which drops, <hi>per deliquium,</hi> from Cockle-ſhells, coagulated with Spirit of Salt; the Powder of greaſie Beetles, or of Hog-lice; theſe are all approv'd for their <hi>anti-hydropic</hi> Vertue.</p>
                        <p>Sudorifics are not proper in an <hi>Aſcites,</hi> by reaſon that they heat and fret the <hi>Serum,</hi> and diſſolve the Blood, ſo as to occaſion a further effuſion of <hi>Serum</hi> into the Cavities. In caſe of an <hi>Anaſarca,</hi> or when the <hi>Serum</hi> ſtagnates in the <hi>Glandules</hi> and Bowels, they are uſeful, and ought to be given in ſmall quantities, leſt a ſtronger force ſhould weaken the Patient. Juniper-Wood, Millet-ſeeds, and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable Aromatics, together with volatil Salts, are the moſt proper Ingredients; and ought to be adminiſter'd in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid form. Sometimes Mercurial Salivations are alſo of uſe in deſperat <hi>Dropſies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After the internal Remedies for evacuating the hydropical Serum; we come in the next place, to what aſſiſtance external Operations can afford. If the Navel be much rais'd, we apply aperients to it; and if they do not open it, we tap it with a Needle. A <hi>Paracenteſis</hi> is alſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently perform'd on the ſide of the Belly with good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. But we ought to remember, that in <hi>Dropſies,</hi> the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> is very thick; that 'tis dangerous to take out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove eight or ten Ounces of Water at once; that if the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe be confirm'd, and the Bowels beſet with Schirrus's or already corroded by the Water; and if the larger Lympha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Veſſels be broken, or if the <hi>Dropſy</hi> be univerſal, a <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centeſis</hi>
                           <pb n="311" facs="tcp:207638:156"/>is of no uſe. Sometimes, if Nature tend that way, the <hi>Scrotum</hi> opens of it ſelf, or if it do not, 'tis artificially open'd with a Cautery or a Launce. But it ought to be carefully defended, by proper Preſervatives, from a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene; to which 'tis very liable. Slight ſcarrifications of the Legs are oft-times of good uſe; but the Wounds muſt be gently handled, and frequently fomented with the Spirit of Wine camphoris'd, in order to prevent a Gangrene. If Bliſters riſe in the Legs, we apply Cole-wort Leaves to 'em; nay, oft-times the Leaves of Water-Plantane bruis'd, and applied, raiſe Bliſters of themſelves, which void a great deal of Serum. Bliſtering Plaiſters are us'd with good ſucceſs; but they ought to be cautiouſly applied to the outermoſt Parts, becauſe they extinguiſh the native heat, and promote a Gangrene. Upon which account, Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtics, which fortifie the Part with an <hi>Eſchara,</hi> and do not attract the Humors ſo violently, are more proper. But if the Diſeaſe be confirm'd, and if the Perſon be weak and cold, then they may introduce a Gangrene, or, at leaſt, will only give vent to the Water under the Skin, as not being able to extend their influence to the Cavities. Some chooſe to pair the Nails of the Toes very cloſe, and tye ſtrait Ligatures upon the Parts. The former Stratagem drains the Water, and the latter cuts off all further Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, and forces the impriſon'd Matter either to retire into the Lymphatic Veſſels, or march out by the proper Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages.</p>
                        <p>Having thus diſpatch'd the firſt Indication, we are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at the ſecond, which was to corroborat the Stomac, and Craſis of the Blood; for which end, chalybeat Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines ought to be mix'd with the above mention'd Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, eſpecially to Worm-wood and Ground-Ivy; which laſt is of excellent uſe both inwardly and outwardly. The Salt of Wormwood coagulated with the Spirit of Salt; the Tincture of Tartar, Tincture of the Vitriol of Steel, the <hi>Terra foliata</hi> of Tartar, and the <hi>Lapis Fulmina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> pounded with Alcohol of Wine, and mix'd with the Powder of Snakes Caſt-Coats, are much applauded for the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>If the Fibres of the Skin be weak and relaxated, it will not be improper to Bath it with the Spirit of Wine and ſtrong Waters; as for aſtringent Fomentations, I doubt they do more harm than good. If the Veſſels or Organs be broke, we may add vulnerary Ingredients to the above
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:207638:157"/>mention'd Specifics. If the difficulty of breathing be very troubleſome, 'tis uſual to give a dram of <hi>Sperma Caeti</hi> in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wine, after vomiting. If Hydropical Perſons be extream thirſty, we muſt be very cautious of pleaſing them, or anſwering their demands, ſince abſtinence from Drink is the better part of the Cure. Nitre melted in the Mouth, Wine temper'd with Juice of Citrons, the dulcifi'd Spirit of Salt, Vinegar diluted with Chalybeat Water, and the Decoction of Juniper Berries in Whey, given for ordinary drinking, are of uſe for mitigating this Symptom.</p>
                        <p>In the mean while, it will not be improper to inject Clyſters of hydropical Purgatives, and aromatic Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, or of Herrin-Pickle, or of a Child's Urine, impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with carminative Seeds in caſe of Wind; or mix'd with Turpentin and Nitre. Nor will it be amiſs to apply diſcuſſive Aromatics to the ſoles of the Feet, Belly, and Cod. Such are the Leaves of Celandin the greater, Bags quilted with aromatic Seeds and Bran; Man's Ordure; Goats Dung boil'd in Mint-Water, or mix'd with Man's Urin in the form of a Cataplaſm; Horſe's Dung mix'd after the ſame method, with Meal of Barley and Vinegar. Quick-lime-Water mix'd with Spirit of Wine is of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent uſe for bathing the Legs, Belly, and Scrotum, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when a Gangrene is threaten'd, by the appearance of Spots. Cataplaſms made of Cockles bruis'd together with their Shells, and mix'd with Goats-Dung, are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly recommended by <hi>Thonerus.</hi> If theſe Cataplaſms prove uneaſie, they may be ſhifted for aromatic Oyls; ſuch as the Oyl of Scorpions, diſtill'd Oyl of Juniper, Oyl of Bays, Oyl of Toads, mix'd with the Ointments <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pae, Martiatum, &amp;c.</hi> Or, an Ointment made of Sulphur, Quick-lime, and the Extracts of ſharp Plants.

                        <head>ART. 3. <hi>Of the Yellow, Black, and White Jaundice.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>A <hi>Jaundice</hi> is a cachectic diſpoſition of Body, attended by a preternatural Colour of the Skin; it is caus'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the corruption of the Chyle in the Stomac; or its vicious fermentation with the Bile and Juice of the <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas</hi> in the <hi>Duodenum;</hi> or by the immediat putrification of the Maſs of Blood. The firſt cauſe defiles the Maſs of Blood, and taints it with various Recrements according to the manner of its corruption. Hence Milk curdled in the Stomacs of Children, Summer-Fruits, Cucumbers, Fiſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being converted into a muſty Crudity, will cauſe a <hi>Jaundice,</hi> by mixing the corrupt Chyle with the Blood, which being unfit for nouriſhment or aſſimilation, is thrown out in a ſerous Vehicle upon the Glandules of the Skin, and ſometimes upon internal Glandules.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Jaundices</hi> which follow Feavers, or extreme bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which are attended by vomiting of yellow corrupt Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, muſty Belchings, Heart-burnings, and Excrements co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd as in a healthy ſtate, ſeem to ariſe from this cauſe, and are accordingly cur'd by Vomits, and bitter ſtomachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Medicines.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond Cauſe takes place when an Acid prevails, and the Bile is lazy or unactive, and either cannot make good its ſecretion through the Liver, and conſequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coils into the Blood; or, when ſeparated, ſtagnates in the Gall-Bladder, and ſettles into Stones, ſo as to cauſe an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Paſſage: Hence ſulphureous ſtrong Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, that exalt the Oyl of the Bile, and cramp its active Volatil Salt, are frequently charg'd with cauſing a Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. Sometimes the Convulſions of the neighbouring Membranes may contract the Gall-Bladder, and ſo ſhut up the Paſſage, upon which account Vomiting, Colic-pains, Hyſteric Paſſions, and hard Labour in Child-bearing, are obſerv'd to introduce this Diſeaſe. The prevalency of an Acid in the <hi>Duodenum,</hi> ariſing either from the auſtere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements of the Stomac, or the degeneracy of the Juice of the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> will alſo pervert the Chyle, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Maſs of Blood. So that the greateſt part of Jaundices are wholly owing to a preternatural corrupt Acid in the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:207638:158"/>Stomac or <hi>Duodenum,</hi> and the inactivity or imperfect di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of the Chyle.</p>
                        <p>As for the third Cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> The immediat putrefication of the Maſs of Blood, 'tis occaſion'd by Poyſon, birings of Vipers or Mad Dogs, malignant Ulcers, ſuppreſſion of the Terms, the Scurvy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And when a Jaundice ſprings from this cauſe, the Stomac, Bile, and Colour of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements continue in their natural ſtate.</p>
                        <p>Now any of theſe three Cauſes will occaſion a preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural colour of the Skin, which always attends the Jaundice. For the Blood being vitiated and tinctur'd with corrupt Recrements, precipitats and throws 'em out in a ſerous Vehicle upon the Skin, where the miliar Glandules are moſt plentiful; and theſe vicious particles tincture the Skin, according to their various texture. If an urinous Oyl pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, the Colour is yellow; if an Acid from the firſt Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, it becomes green or black, and frequently a yellow Jaundice is converted to that of a Green or Black Colour, by the growing prevalency of the Acid. 'Tis true, the Ancients fancy'd that the Yellow Colour proceeded from a redundancy of Bile, and the Black from a melancholic Humour, imputed to the Spleen. But Experience teaches us, that the genuin Bile is apt to cauſe a red Colour; that ſuch Medicines as whet and volatilize the Bile, are proper againſt this Diſeaſe; that a Yellow Jaundice becomes Black without any influence from the Spleen, and that there are ſeveral Yellow Jaundice's, in which the Bile is not redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant nor ſtop'd in its paſſage, as thoſe which proceed from corrupt Chyle bred in the Stomac, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Jaundice is call'd <hi>Secondary,</hi> when it follows other Diſeaſes; and if it be accompany'd by ſigns of Concoction, 'tis <hi>Critical;</hi> if not, 'tis <hi>Symptomatical.</hi> But if it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent, and come of it ſelf, 'tis a <hi>Primary</hi> Diſeaſe; and is uſher'd in by theſe Symptoms. <hi>Firſt,</hi> a preſſing ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Pain girds the Breaſt, wearineſs poſſeſſes the Limbs, a loathing invades the Stomac, the reſpiration becomes diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult; and Giddineſs, Head-Aches, and Swoonings ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cloſe up the rear. The Urin at firſt is pale, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards (when the Blood begins to precipitat its Recrements) it becomes thick, obſcure, as of a dark red Colour, and dies a Cloth yellow like Saffron. The Whites of the Eyes being enrich'd with many little Arteries, appear Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; the Mouth is dry, and frequently moleſted with a bitter taſte, and averſion to Ale. Sometimes a Feaver ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:207638:159"/>a Jaundice, and ſometimes it does not. When the Bile is ſtopp'd, the Belly is coſtive, the Excrements White, and a violent pain moleſts the right Hypocondrium, as being ſuppos'd to proceed from Stones in the Gall-Bladder. In other caſes, the Belly is open, and the Excrements repreſent a bilious Colour. A Jaundice is dangerous when 'tis Black, or proceeds from a prevailing Acid, or ſucceeds to Chronical Diſeaſes, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Feavers, obſtructions of the Liver or Spleen, or ſtones in the Gall-Bladder; in which laſt caſe, tho' cur'd, it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently relapſes. When the Urin becomes thich and Black, it prognoſticates a happy delivery.</p>
                        <p>The Cure conſiſts in correcting the Acid and auſtere Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, proceeding from the Stomac and Inteſtines: or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieving the due texture and diſtribution of the Bile; and promoting the ſeparation of the heterogeneous Particles. To obtain theſe ends, let an Antimonial Vomit be firſt exhibited. Purgation is improper, eſpecially when the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the Gall are ſtraiten'd, rather than obſtructed; in which, the Vomits themſelves are not ſo uſeful as in other caſes. If it be needful to clear the Paſſages, Gum Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac, and Tartar vitriolated, or ſome ſuch laxative, will ſuffice.</p>
                        <p>Of Specific Alteratives, the filings of Steel, or its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract prepar'd with Juice of Apples, or chalybeat Wine, and prepar'd Blood-ſtone, which partakes much of Steel, are much the beſt; to which we join the Juice, Infuſion, or Decoction of Celandin Roots in Wine; the Eſſence, Extract, or Decoction of Hore-hound; the Powder of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lombine-Seeds; the Conſerve of the Flowers of Broom, and St. <hi>John</hi>'s Wort, the Powder of Madder Roots; the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, or Effence of Swallow-wort; the Decoctions of Silver-weed, Agrimony, Wormwood, leſſer Centory, Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thernwood, the five opening Roots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Decoction of Raiſins and Straw-berry-leaves, for ordinary drinking.</p>
                        <p>Beſides the Vegetable Specifics, Earth-Worms or Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, given in Powder to a Dram; or the Spirit prepar'd from 'em; the Spirit and Tincture of Tartar, the carmina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Spirit <hi>de tribus,</hi> the Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> Spirit of Man's Urine; and the Urine it ſelf drunk with the Juice of Hore-hound; are of noted efficacy. The Dung of Geeſe, or that of other Animals, given in Powder to a dram, is much approv'd. Some recommend the Stone taken out of
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:207638:159"/>the Gall of an Ox, given to a dram; And the <hi>Bezoar</hi> Stone; or the <hi>Lapis Fulminaris,</hi> given to half a dram. Some order three or four living Lice to be ſwallow'd.</p>
                        <p>In the declination of the Diſeaſe, gentle Laxatives mix'd with the above mention'd Specifics, are allowable, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Rhubarb given in Powder or Infuſion; or the Infuſion of Senna with Salt of Tartar; or the Flowers of <hi>Acacia,</hi> or thoſe of the wild Plum-Tree, infus'd in Wine, or in the ordinary Drink. In a Black Jaundice, the Extract of black Hellebor, mix'd with that of Steel, and Gum Ammoniac, is very uſeful.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are the internal Medicins, proper to be given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Jaundice, as being all calculated for ſharpening the Bile, ſubduing Acids, and promoting a regular chyli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: In the uſe of which, we ought ſtill to continue 'till the Urin become thick and black.</p>
                        <p>Externally ſome apply the Leaves of leſſer Centory, or Celandin Roots to the ſoles of the Feet; and bathe the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in hot Water, impregnated with Specific Plants, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to open its Pores; or rub it all over with Bags of the Meal of Barly and Beans dipp'd in hot Water. Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſms of the Leaves of Hore-hound, Celandin Roots, and Miſleto of the Oak, beaten up with Wine and Vinegar, and applied to the Feet, are of excellent uſe for big-belly'd Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who dare not venture upon the uſe of internal Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fics.</p>
                        <p>It remains only to annex a few Examples of Recipe's.</p>
                        <p>Take of Aloes and Extract of leſſer Centory, of each a ſcruple; Extract of Troches Alhandal, ſix grains; <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius vitae,</hi> two grains. Make Pills for four Doſes.</p>
                        <p>Take of Columbine Seeds, ſix drams: With Celandin-Water make an Emulſion; to which add Powder of Ivory, a dram and a half.</p>
                        <p>Take of Columbine Seeds in Powder, ſix drams; Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron, one dram; Tartar vitriolat, half a dram. Make a Powder for ſeven Doſes, to be taken in Rheniſh Wine.</p>
                        <p>Take of chalybeat diaphoretic Antimony, and Turmeric-Roots, of each half a dram; volatil Salt of Harts-horn, half a ſcruple. Make a Powder for two Doſes.</p>
                        <p>Take of Madder-roots, and thoſe of Celandin, of each an ounce; Leaves of Hore-hound, and tops of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, of each a handful; Salt of Tartar, two drams. Make a Bag to be infus'd in Wine.</p>

                        <head>ART. 4. <hi>Of the French Pox.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THE Symptoms of the <hi>French-Pox</hi> diſplay themſelves moſt in the part, thro' which the virulency is firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd. If a Nurſe be infected by a ſucking Child, her Breaſts are firſt attack'd; if the Diſeaſe be contracted by lying in Bed with a fowl Perſon, the Skin and ſurface of the Body are the chief place where its Retainers aſſemble. If the Embraces of a foul Woman give Being to it, the Yard, Groin, and adjacent Parts are the firſt Scene of its tragical appearance. About two or three days after the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal Adventure, a Heat and Inflammation ſeizes the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitals, the Urine ſcalds, a ſharp corroding Matter iſſues from the Yard, inflames the Prepuce, and beſets it with Puſhes, which in tract of time degenerat into Ulcers; Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo's, or hard ſwellings appear in the Groin; Red yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Spots are obſerv'd in the Belly, Breaſt, Back, and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which when preſs'd, aſſume a whitiſh Colour, but quickly retrieve the former. In proceſs of time, the Wheals or Ulcers ſpread over the Body, eſpecially the Forehead, Face and Palat; their Colour is livid, incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to a Yellow; ſometimes they are dry, ſcaly, and of an unequal ſurface; at other times they void ſharp corrupt Matter, which frequently corrodes the ſpungy Bones of the Noſe and Palat. The Bones are cover'd with hard ſtony Concretions, and the Limbs tortur'd with violent Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pains, but ſo as that the Joints are free; and in inveterat caſes, become corrupt and rotten. Little Swellings call'd <hi>Condylomata,</hi> cover the Breech, and cruſty Warts invade many parts of the Body. The Palms of the Hands, and Soles of the Feet are chopp'd and moleſted with a burning Heat; the Hairs fall off from the Head, Eye-lids, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Palat of the Throat being relaxated or corroded, alters the Voice; the Ears tingle; and in fine, the whole Body becomes man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and ſordid, and, by degrees, moulders away. The Symptoms of Women differ not from thoſe of Men, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what regards the form of their Genitals.</p>
                        <pb n="319" facs="tcp:207638:160"/>
                        <p>The material cauſe of the Pox is a corroſive acid Ferment joyn'd to a viſcid Vehicle, which affects chiefly the glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and nervous parts; it depraves the Lymph and Serum, the nutritious Juice of the Bones, and the dewy Liquors of the whole Body; it corrodes the ſolid parts; twitches the Membrans, and is every way qualify'd for being the Bane of Life, and Ruin of Mankind. 'Tis very infectious, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times propagats it ſelf among Bed-fellows, by Sweat or Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter iſſuing from the Ulcers, by kiſſing when the Lips are ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated, by hereditary Succeſſion, and many other ways, beſides that of perfect Enjoyment.</p>
                        <p>If it be inveterat, or hereditary, or return after Salivation; if attended by the Scurvy, or obſtructions of the Bowels, or troubleſome Catarrhs; and if the Bones of the Head are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roded; it is not eaſily cur'd. Dry hot Conſtitutions are more in danger than thoſe whoſe Bodies are moiſt and open. The forwardneſs and Suppuration of the Bubo's facilitats the Cure. If the Blood drawn forth become florid; and free of thoſe livid blewiſh Spots that uſe to appear in its ſurface, and withal be not over ſerous, 'tis a teſtimony of a perfect Cure.</p>
                        <p>The Cure of the French Pox, which conſiſts in attenuating the viſcid Humors, correcting and extinguiſhing the Acid, and evacuating both, is obtain'd either by ſudorific Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or mercurial Salivations. The former are calculated for a recent Pox, and bilious, ſcorbutic, or melancholic Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, to whom Mercury is ſo pernicious; and ought to be preceded by Purgatives. The moſt noted Ingredients are <hi>Guajacum</hi> and <hi>Saſſaperilla.</hi> The Doſe of the former ought to be inlarg'd for cold Conſtitutions; and that of the latter, for ſuch as are hot. To theſe two I chooſe to add Juniper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood.</p>
                        <p>The other Specifics are Burdock Roots, Soap-wort, Saſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafras, Box wood, Maſtic wood, Oak wood, Arſmart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The common Vehicle for ſudorific Decoctions is Water; but when the Stomac is weak, we may add Wine towards the end of the Decoction. For emaciated Perſons, ſome boyl 'em in Whey. When theſe Sudorifics are firſt us'd, we ought not to be too haſty in forcing the Patient to ſweat; but to wait ſome days 'till the Humors are gradually prepar'd, and the Body incline to it. Beſides, if they happen to operat more by Urine, than by Stool, 'tis not proper to recall the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors that move that way; nay on the contrary, we ought to add Diuretics, and endeavour to diſcharge the virulent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the Paſſage to which Nature directs. When the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:207638:161"/>are ſufficiently prepar'd and diſpos'd for ſweating, the Patient may be moderatly cover'd up, and the Vertue of the Sudorific promoted by drinking warm Broth (the Decoction it ſelf being alſo drunk warm) or kindling Spirit of Wine; and while he continues thus to ſweat daily, let a Purge be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited every ſeventh day.</p>
                        <p>Take of the ſhavings of <hi>Guajacum,</hi> ſix ounces; the rinds of <hi>Guajacum,</hi> two ounces; <hi>Saſſaperilla</hi> roots, two ounces; ſhavings of Saſſafras, an ounce; quick Silver purify'd by the addition of an Alcali, and Antimony in coarſe Powder, both ty'd in a Bag, of each a Pound. Macerat them in common Water for forty eight Hours; then boyl them till two thirds be evaporated. Some add Soap-wort, Hyſſop, Speedwell, Liquorice Roots, Raiſins, Burdock Roots, Fennel Seeds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Doſe of ſuch a Decoction is from four to eight ounces, according to the circumſtances of the Patient: To be taken only in the Morning for two or three days without ſweating. But after theſe preparatory Days are over, let the Patient be put into a dry or wet Bagnio, according as his Conſtitution is moiſt or dry, about an hour after taking a Doſe. And after an Hour's ſweating, let him retire to a Bed, where the Sweat may finiſh its progreſs of its own accord. But in the mean while the Sweat muſt be carefully rub'd off, and the Sheets or Cloaths ſhifted after ſweating, and well waſh'd and air'd before they be us'd again. This method muſt be perſiſted in for four or ſix Weeks, till all the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms diſappear, and the Diſeaſe be totally rooted out. In the Interim let the Diet be thin and dry. A ſecond Decoction of the ſame Ingredients may be given for ordinary drinking; and Raiſins, or ſome ſuch light thing, for Supper.</p>
                        <p>If the Diſeaſe be inveterat, it will be needful to raiſe a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livation by the uſe of Mercury; ſince ſudorific Decoctions cannot of themſelves reach the Cure, tho' they may ſtill be uſeful during the progreſs of the Salivation, for attenuating and preparing the Humors: But they muſt be ſo order'd, that they do not procure Sweat. The beſt preparation of Mercury for internal uſe, in order to ſalivat, is the red Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitat from Quick-ſilver diſſolv'd in the Spirit of Nitre and Allum, given to four grains, and repeated twice or thrice. Sweet Mercury is rather a Laxative, unleſs it be fix'd by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Sublimation, and mix'd with Yelks of Eggs. But the moſt effectual way of procuring a Salivation, is that of inunction with mercurial Ointments. As,</p>
                        <pb n="321" facs="tcp:207638:161"/>
                        <p>Take of Quick-ſilver purify'd, ſix ounces; Hogs Fat, not ſalted, a pound. Mix them exactly and add of the Gelly of Ox Feet, half on ounce; Turpentine, three oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; diſtill'd Oyl of Turpentine, an ounce, make an Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. With which anoint the Soles of the Feet, Palms of the Hands, Wriſts, Ancles, Elbows, Knees, and Backbone, from the Shoulders down to the <hi>Os ſacrum,</hi> twice a Day for three ſucceſſive Days. Two ounces of the Ointment will ſuffice for each inunction, and about the fourth Day if the Salivation advance one inunction more will ſerve. If it do not, we muſt continue to anoint; and if all prove ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, we ought to obſerve nicely where the Impediment lies. If the Stagnation and Viſcidity of the Humors about the Breaſt retard the work, let a Vomit be exhibited; If want of ſtrength and Spirits, let the ſudorific Decoctions be Adminiſtred. The Salivation being obtain'd muſt be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd till the <hi>Saliva</hi> become foetid, and viſcous, and apt to fall to the bottom in a Veſſel full of Water, or ſtick to its ſides. If the Salivation exceed its due bounds, let Opiats, Clyſters, and Purgatives be us'd, as alſo Gold both held in the Mouth, and given inwardly.</p>
                        <p>After the Salivation is over it will be requiſit to ſhift the Bed-Cloaths and wearing Cloaths, and to continue the uſe of the Decoctions of Woods. Which if the Salivation was imperfect may recal the Nocturnal Pains, by driving the remaining Acid, diſſolv'd by the Mercury, into the external Parts, but their continu'd uſe, with that of Mercury will overcome 'em. Purgation is alſo proper after the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livation.</p>
                        <p>Before the Commencement of the Cure, as well by a Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation as by Sweating, it is not amiſs to cleanſe the firſt Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages by Vomits and Purges, that ſo the humors may be more pliable, and the troubleſom Symptoms of the Breaſt prevented. If the Pox be inveterat, or if the virulent Matter be fix'd in the external Parts, one or two Purges will ſuffice; ſince we ought to be cautious of recalling the humors to the Center. When the Matter is joyn'd to the fluid Juices, repeated Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is of uſe. For which end, Coloquyntida and ſweet Mercury are the topping Ingredients. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of the extract of Black Hellebor, and ſweet Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, of each fifteen Grains; Scammony Sulphurat, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of Troches Alhandal, of each two grains. With Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Fumitory or that of Woods; Make Pills.</p>
                        <pb n="322" facs="tcp:207638:162"/>
                        <p>Take of the Conſerve of Fumitory, a dram; Roſin of Jalap, Sulphurat Scammony, of each ſix grains; Turbith Mineral, four grains. Make a Bolus.</p>
                        <p>Some add Purgatives to the Sudorific Woods; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe volatil Salts, urinous Spirits, and Cinnabar of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, together with the extracts and diſtill'd Oyls of Woods. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of the ſhavings of Guajacum, four ſcruples; Diaphoretic Sulphur of Antimony, a ſctuple; vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Salt of Vipers, twelve grains. Make a Powder for two Doſes. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Matthiolus</hi> his Quinteſſence, half an ounce; Spirit of Venice Treacle, a dram; Clyſſus of Antimony, half a dram; Spirit of Guajacum, two drams. Mix for a Doſe, to be pour'd into each draught of the Sudorific De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction.</p>
                        <p>Before we take leave of this Subject, it will be requiſit to conſider the Symptoms, and account for their particular Cures. The firſt that offers it ſelf is the Clap, or virulent running of the Reins. This Symptom appears frequently by it ſelf without the Pox, but if it be not ſpeedily cur'd degenerats into it. The cauſe of it is ſome ſharp <hi>Miaſma</hi>'s proceeding from Ulcers in the Womb, which in the time of Coition inſinuat themſelves thro' the Urethra and inlarged Pores of the Yard, into the <hi>Proſtatae,</hi> and by fermenting corrupt their watery Juice, which in time becomes Corroſive, Ulcerats the Glandules, and Excoriats the Urethra and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puce. Hence the Symptoms of a Clap are, a violent pain about the Root of the Yard, where theſe Glandules are ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; a continual Efflux of diſcolour'd matter, as being firſt yellow, then green and blue; the Inflammation and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Ulceration of the Nut of the Yard, the Corroſion of the Urethra, follow'd by Caruncles, an inſufferable Heat of Urine and a ſqueezing Pain girding the Yard, eſpecially in the Night-time, or when it attempts Erection. If a Clap con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long it Excoriats and Waſts the Glandules, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the malign ferment reaches the Stones, and cauſes their Swellings and Bubo's.</p>
                        <p>The firſt ſtep towards the Cure, is to cleanſe the Body by purging with Coloquintida, the extract of black Hellebor and ſweet Mercury, or rather the green precipitat prepar'd with Quick-lime; which tho' it may ſeem at firſt to exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perat the Symptoms, yet it lays the Foundation of the Cure. After Evacuation we proceed to Balmy, cleanſing, and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:207638:162"/>Ingredients, in regard of the Ulcer of the <hi>Proſtratae.</hi> Such are the diſtill'd Oyl of Turpentine, the Turpentine Balſam of Sulphur, joyn'd to <hi>Quercetanus</hi>'s Clap Water, the Juice of Lemons mix'd with Spirit of Turpentine and Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyr, the Balſam prepar'd of Sugar of Lead and Oyl of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine, Oyl of Juniper, extract of Tormentil, Roſin of Guajacum prepar'd with Tincture of Tartar, the Decoction of Quick-ſilver in Water, the Balſam of <hi>Peru,</hi> and above all that call'd <hi>Capaivi,</hi> or its Eſſence prepar'd with Tartaris'd Spirit of Wine. Some commend the infuſion of Cantha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides in Wine. To theſe we may add the Bone of a Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, Diaphoretic Antimony, Chalybeat Bezoar, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſubdues a prevailing Acid. If the Infection have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy reach'd the Blood, it will be needful to adminiſter Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Woods, and the above mention'd ſudorifics, mix'd with the Eſſences of Woods, and Tincture of Coral.</p>
                        <p>Take of Turbith mineral, ſix or eight grains; With Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of Roſes make a Bolus.</p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Extractum Catholicum,</hi> fifteen grains; the green precipitat Mercury, ſix grains; extract of Troches Alhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, two grains; with the Eſſence of Woods, or diſtill'd Oyl of Amber make Pills.</p>
                        <p>Take of the extract of Tormentil, an ounce; Sugar of Lead, half an ounce; Camphyr, two drams. With diſtill'd Oyl of Turpentine. Make Pills.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Balſam of Sulphur, prepar'd with Oyl of Turpentine, two drams; Balſam of <hi>Capaivi,</hi> a dram. Mix Doſe fifteen drops, twice a Day.</p>
                        <p>Externally for cleanſing the Ulcers, we inject Quick-lime Water, in which Aloe, Myrrh, Honey of Roſes, Sugar of Lead, and ſweet Mercury are diſſolv'd. If the Ulcers tend to a Cancer we add <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Aegyptiacum;</hi> or if an Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer appear in the Nut of the Yard, we waſh it with a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of ſublimat Mercury in the ſame Water. If the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticles are inflam'd, we apply Cataplaſms of the Meal of Beans and Cuminſeeds boyl'd in Vinegar and Water, and mix'd with Litharge; or anoint 'em with a Liniment of the Balſam of Sulphur, Oyl of Cummin, and Ointment of Marſh-mallows; and if any hardneſs remain, diſcuſs it with a Plaiſter of Gum Ammoniac and the Plaiſter of Hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock. The Plaiſter <hi>de Ranis</hi> with Mercury is of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent uſe for other places; but for the Teſticles 'tis not ſo proper, for fear the Mercury ſhould extinguiſh their fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If the Prepuce be inflam'd, foment it with the
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:207638:163"/>Phlegm of Vitriol, or Diſſolution of Sugar of Lead in Lime Water.</p>
                        <p>A Clap in Women is cur'd after the ſame manner, and attended by Symptoms of the ſame Nature.</p>
                        <p>The next Symptom we take notice of, is that of Bubo's or Glandulous ſwellings, occaſion'd by the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>agnation of viſcid Lymph. Their ſuppuration ought to be promoted by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying <hi>Sala</hi>'s Magnetic Plaiſter, or Toads ſoak'd in Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, or the Plaiſter <hi>de Ranis</hi> with Mercury, ſoften'd with Oyl of Guajacum or foetid Oyl of Tartar, or the Plaiſter of Hemlock, mix'd with Soap. When the Bubo's are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſoften'd, let 'em be open'd, with a Cauſtic, or a Lance, and kept long open by applying the Balſam of St. <hi>John</hi>'s wort, with Oyl of Tartar, and the Plaiſter O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podeldoch. If either the Suppuration or Cleanſing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance but ſlowly, Cupping-glaſſes are of uſe, for attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating the ſtubborn Matter. But after all, if there be any ground for ſuſpecting a Cancer, we muſt lay aſide the thoughts of Suppuration, and indeavour the Cure internally, by adminiſtring firſt the Decoction of Guajacum, then Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives, and in the laſt place the Spirit and Salt of Vipers: And if theſe prove ineffectual, by the univerſal Method for the Pox.</p>
                        <p>As for the Puſhes and Pimples that attend the Pox, 'tis convenient to waſh 'em, with the Decoction of Woods, and Oyl of Tartar; and touch 'em gently with ſome Spirit impregnated with the Tincture of Copper, or with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Mixture. Take of Plantane Water, ſix ounces; Sublimat Mercury, four ſcruples; Allum, half an ounce. Mix and apply with a Feather. This mixture is alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the Swellings of the fundament; unleſs they be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry large, in which caſe we Root 'em out with Ligatures, or with a Knife, and apply the mixture to the remains. Warts are remov'd by applying Oyl of Vitriol or <hi>Aqua Fortis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Ulcers uſually diſappear after Salivation. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they are cleans'd by applying the Solution of Sublimat Mercury in Plantane Water, or an Ointment of common Oyl, Ceruſs, Red Lead, Sublimat Mercury and white Wax. After they are ſufficiently cleans'd, as the laudable Colour of the Pus and ſides of the Wound will diſcover, we apply the Decoction of Woods and vulnerary Plants, with Sugar of Lead and Lime Water, and the Plaiſter <hi>Diaſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> with that of Norinberg. The external Ulcers of the Yard are treated after the ſame manner. If they are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:207638:163"/>we inject the above-mention'd Liquors, or put in a Wax Candle cover'd with the foregoing Ointment. For thoſe of the Womb, the ſame method will ſuffice. As for Ulcers of the Mouth and Palate, we muſt take care that the Cauſtic when applied be not ſwallow'd down; if they are ſeated in the upper ſide of the Palate, we inject the healing Decoctions thro' the Noſe. Such are the Decoctions of Plantane, Self-heal, Scabious, of each a handful; red Roſes, two little handfuls; Sarſaperilla, an ounce; Guajacum and red Sanders, of each ſix drams; Sumac, half an ounce. To two pound and a half of the ſtrain'd Liquor, we add two ounces of the Syrup of dry Roſes, and as much of that of Mulberries. The Ulcers of the Noſe ought to be firſt waſh'd with emollient Decoctions and Oyls, by reaſon of their Cruſt; and then with the Aſtringent Vulnerary Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, mix'd with Allum and Lime Water.</p>
                        <p>The Chops of the Hands and Feet are waſh'd with the Decoction of Woods, ſweet Mercury, and Quick-lime; to which if the Chops be hard, we add emollient Ingredients; after waſhing we anoint 'em with Sublimat or ſweet Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the Oyl of Tartar, incorporated with <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Enulatum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If the Bones be Rotten, we ſcrape 'em with a Knife, or, if that method prove ſucceſsleſs, we apply a hot Iron, and then waſh 'em with Spirit of Wine. The Bones of the Palat muſt be cover'd with a Plate of Silver or Gold. For pains in the Bones remaining after the general Cure, we apply the following Plaiſter. Take of <hi>Vigo</hi>'s Plaiſter, with a quadruple quantity of Mercury, an ounce and a half; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd Oyl of Nutmegs, and Opium diſſolv'd in Vinegar, of each half an ounce; thicken'd juice of Tobacco, and common Cinnabar, of each an ounce; Saffron, ſix drams. With Turpentine make a Plaiſter. If a ſwelling remain af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Pains are over. apply Clouts dip'd in freſh Butter boyl'd in Wine till it Evaporat.</p>
                        <p>The hard ſtony Concretions that frequently beſet the Bones yield to a Salivation, interlac'd with preparations from Vipers and Antimony. Externally we apply <hi>Vigo's</hi> Plaiſter, with a quadruple quantity of Mercury, ſoften'd with the diſtill'd Oyl of Guajacum, or the following Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. Take of <hi>Diachylon,</hi> with Gums, and Oyl of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lives, of each four ounces; new Wax, an ounce; black Pepper, half an ounce; common Salt, two drams; Spaniſh Flies, a dram; Muſtard-ſeed, a ſcruple; thicken'd Hony,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:207638:164"/>two ſcruples: Make a Plaiſter to be applied above a piece of very fine Linnen, and ty'd faſt to the part, the Linnen underneath being chang'd twice a day. If theſe hard ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings are very painful, apply a Liniment of the Oyl of Turpentin, diſtill'd Oyl of Guajacum, Quick-ſilver and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium: Some apply a Plate of Lead cover'd with Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; or a Plate of malleable Mercury prepar'd thus. Take of Lead a Pound, and melt it; while 'tis yet liquid, put a Bar of Iron into it 'till it begin to thicken. Then ſhift the Iron, and put an ounce of Quick-ſilver into its place, where 'twill congeal. After 'tis thus congeal'd, ſeparate it with a Knife, and boyl it thrice in a Pound of Oyl, till the Oyl be ſet on fire every time.</p>
                        <p>If this Method prove ineffectual, apply bliſtering-Plaiſters, and cut Iſſues above the Part, or open the Tumor with an actual Cauſtic, and keep it open for a long time.</p>
                        <p>The Scab and Tetter that ſometimes attend the Pox, are remov'd by touching 'em with the ſolution of ſublimat Mercury in Arſmart-Water; and applying the Oyl of <hi>Tartar per deliquium,</hi> with Hogs-fat.</p>
                        <p>The Head-Aches are cur'd by applying <hi>Vigo</hi>'s Plaiſter, with Mercury, Caſtor, and <hi>Laudanum Opiatum;</hi> or by trepana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if the Venereal virulency be extinguiſh'd. The ting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Ears is cur'd by injecting the Infuſion of Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacum, Caſtor and Mint in Aſſes Urine, or the following Eſſence.</p>
                        <p>Take of Saſſafras Wood and Lavender-Flowers, of each a Dram; Guajacum-Bark and Caſtor, of each half a dram; Cloves a ſcruple; Spirit of Wine, three Ounces. Digeſt for ſome Days, and ſtrain the Eſſence for uſe.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>THere's a ſort of Cachexy that frequently reigns in our <hi>Northern</hi> Climats, whoſe Symptoms appearing moſtly in the <hi>Hypocondria,</hi> have Chriſten'd it the <hi>Hypocondri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac Evil.</hi> And when its Symptoms are very fierce and exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 'tis intituled the <hi>Scurvy;</hi> a Name given it by the <hi>Saxons</hi> in <hi>North-Germany,</hi> who are moſt liable to it. The better part of Authors upon this Subject, being amus'd with its
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:207638:164"/>Symptoms and Effects, have vainly fancy'd to eſtabliſh its o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Seat in ſeveral Bowels, that are only accidentally concern'd. For if they trac'd it to its ſtate of Infancy, and firſt Beginning, they had pitch'd upon the Stomac for the place of its Nativity; and the Acid Viſcous Crudities that a faulty Digeſtion occaſions, for its Cauſes.</p>
                        <p>For our further ſatisfaction in this matter, we ſhall briefly run over its Symptoms: And if we find that they owe their Being to an Acid Crudity in the Stomac, ſhall reckon that we've made our point good: In the firſt place, the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit is oft-times over-keen in Hypochondriac Perſons, their Digeſtion being weak, and follow'd by Convulſive or Weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pains in the Stomac, Belchings, Wind and noiſe, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the left ſide of the Belly, where the Colon is ſtraiten'd; they are always Coſtive, and Laxatives operate better in them than proper Purgatives: If an Artificial or Natural Vomiting happen, they throw up Acid Matter, which ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifies the Teeth, and corrodes a Copper Veſſel, ſo as to render it ruſty: After eating, they are oft-times ſeiz'd with a gnawing pain in the Stomach, reaching along the Back, from the lower part to the Neck of the Gullet, (which ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <hi>Nephritic Pains</hi>) as alſo by ſudden fluſhings in the Face; wringing pains in the Guts, palpitations of the Heart, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation of Mind, and a difficulty of breathing, occaſion'd either by viſcous Crudities diſtending the Stomac, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions of the Midriff and Muſcles of the Breaſt, or Wind in the <hi>Abdomen</hi> hindring the deſcent of the Midriff. In proceſs of time, hard Tumors ſometimes infeſt the Intrals, and the convulſive Contractions of the Fibres of the Branches of the <hi>Arteria Caeliaca</hi> cauſe beatings about the Loins. While their Stomac is empty, they are apt to be giddy, and dull; they're liable to Head-aches, loſs of Memory, Fear, Grief, aukward Dreams, and vain Imaginations. Their Pulſe is very inconſtant, and all their Symptoms lyable to periodical Exaſperations. Frequently they are ſenſible (as it were) of Fumes riſing upward from the Belly, and the Paroxyſm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles a <hi>Hyſterical</hi> Fit. In the Paroxyſm the Colour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of their Urine is inconſtant; but when 'tis over, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to a natural Order. Theſe are the Symptoms of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriac Perſons; but all of 'em are rarely to be ſeen in one Perſon. The moſt certain Symptoms that always at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, are Gripings and Wind in the Guts, a weak Stomac, Coſtiveneſs and perturbation of the Head.</p>
                        <pb n="328" facs="tcp:207638:165"/>
                        <p>The Symptoms being thus premis'd, let us now enquire after their Cauſe. The firſt Cauſe is a vicious Acid in the Stomac, enlarging the Appetit, but unfit for Digeſtion. Hence enſues an Acid Crudity in the firſt Paſſages, which depraves the Craſis of the Blood, prevents the due ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of volatil Spirits upon which the Lymph becomes A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid, and the Bile inactive.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are the ſources of all the preceding Symptoms, ſince Wind, Noiſe, griping in the Guts, and coſtiveneſs, are the natural reſult of a viſcous. Acid in the firſt Paſſages; as fluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the Face ariſe from its efferveſcence with the Bile. The Convulſions of the nervous Membranes in ſeveral parts of the Body, are the effect of its irritation; its Crudity impairs the due fermentation of the Blood, and cauſes a palpitation of the Heart, and difficulty of breathing; it depraves the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritious Juice of the Bowels, which ſettles into hard Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and occaſions a degeneracy and auſterity in the Spirits; hence Fear, Melancholy, irregular Thoughts, and uncooth emotions enſue.</p>
                        <p>The remore cauſes that promote Crudities, are acid Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, or ſalt Victuals, or ſuch as are dryed in Smoak; ſince both partake of the Acid Spirit of Salt or Soot: Want of motion to promote Digeſtion, and the ſpeedy aſſimilation of Chyle; nocturnal Study or Care exhauſting the Spirits, impoveriſhing the Blood, and rendering the Lymph A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid. So much for the Symptoms and Cauſes of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocondriac Diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>When this depravation, deriv'd from Acid Crudities in the Stomac, is carried ſo high, that the Blood, Lymph, and all the Juices of the Body are notably perverted, and the vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Acid becomes volatil, malignant, and apt to multiply its influence by Contagion or Hereditary Succeſſion, it is ſtil'd the Scurvy; and is generally attended by ſuch a numberleſs train of various Symptoms, that 'tis cuſtomary to charge it with every uncommon Symptom even of other Diſeaſes. The peculiar Qualities of this ſcorbutical Ferment, are theſe. 1. An aptneſs to attack the Glandules, and pervert their Lymph. 2. A mortal Enmity to the nervous Syſteme; as appears by the following enumeration of its Symptoms.</p>
                        <p>Scorbutical Perſons are troubled with a wearineſs, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſenſe of weight, and a dull obſcure pain in the Limbs. Their Appetit is either too fierce, or quite dejected: Their Gums are liable to Excreſcences, Swellings, and Ulcers; and when rub'd, void either a ſaltiſh, bloody, or ſerous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:207638:165"/>their Teeth are looſe and corroded; their Mouth ſtinks; their Spittle is very ſalt, and ſometimes plainly A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid, eſpecially in a Morning; they are oft-times moleſted with Nocturnal Sweats; and Red, Yellow, or Black Spots upon the Arms and Legs, ſometimes as ſmall as Flea-bites, ſometimes as large as a Crown-piece; and ſometimes the Limbs are beſet with rough ſcaly Swellings like Meaſles; their Skin oft-times itches, and when 'tis ſcratched, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes red, or tends to a ſordid Ulcer.</p>
                        <p>Their Urin is high colour'd, or precipitats a red ſandy fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour'd ſediment, or faſtens red friable Sand upon the ſides and bottom of the Urinal; a fat Cruſt or Skin ſwims on the top, and if look'd upon ſide-ways, appears parti-colour'd like a Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock's Tail; after the Urine is thrown out, the Urinal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a blueiſh Colour, which is not eaſily waſh'd off.</p>
                        <p>They are infeſted with a difficulty of Breathing, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Pains gird the Loins and Back, and wring, nay, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times diſtend and harden the Belly; and are oft-times fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by red Pimples in the Skin, which diſappear ſuddenly. Sometimes they are ſeiz'd with nocturnal Pains in their Limbs, ſhifting from the Arms to the Feet, and <hi>è contra.</hi> After vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent wringing Pains, their external parts frequently become paralytic. Sometimes Convulſions and Hyſterical Symptoms ſeize 'em. Sometimes ſetled fix'd pains invade the Head and Limbs, eſpecially in the Night-time; and reſemble thoſe of the <hi>French Pox.</hi> Sometimes their Legs are infeſted by hard ſtony Concretions that are void of pain, unleſs they walk: The Stomac is frequently provok'd to vomiting; and their Guts to bloody Stools, which are voided without gripings, and after the other Excrements, and ſo are eaſily diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd from the Bloody-flux or the Piles. They are alſo liable to frequent effuſions of blue or greeniſh Blood from other parts of the Body; and to a St. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Fire in their Legs, which if indiſcreetly manag'd, becomes a Gangrene or a malign Ulcer. Their Pulſe is unequal frequently very ſmall, and oft-times intermits. When the Diſeaſe is invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, they're ſubject to Catarrhs, Defluxions, Excoriations, Ulcers, and Conſumptions.</p>
                        <p>From theſe premiſes we draw this Concluſion, that the immediat cauſe of the Scurvy is a volatil ſaline Acid, which irritats the Nerves and Membranes, ſharpens the Lymph, Debauches the innate Spirits of the parts, and perverts the equal temperature of the Blood. The remote Cauſes are
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:207638:166"/>the Sea-Air impregnated with ſalin Acid Vapors, ſalt and viſcous Food, Lazineſs, Weakneſs of Digeſtion, Infection, a hereditary Conveyance, and the influence of Chronical Diſeaſes. <hi>Charleton</hi> diſtinguiſhes a hot Scurvy proceeding from a Sulphur and a fix'd Salt, from that which is Cold, and ſprings from an Acid; as likewiſe <hi>Willis,</hi> who refers the cauſe of hot and cold Scurvy's to the prevalency of Sulphur or Salt. But all theſe differences proceed only from the various Conſtitutions of Patients, thwarting or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the efforts of the ſcorbutical Cauſe.</p>
                        <p>A Scurvy frequently joins it ſelf to other Diſtempers, in ſo much, that without a particular regard to it, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be cur'd. The Signs that argue for the preſence of it, are theſe,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Heat and tickling of the Gums, and effuſion of ſalt, watry, or ſtinking Blood.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. A purple Half-Moon under the Eyes.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Little red Spots like Flea-bites on the Thighs and Legs.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The weakneſs of the Knees.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The ſtinking of the Mouth, eſpecially when the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac is empty.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Sudden and unaccountable Fluſhings all over the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
                        <p n="7">7: The flame-Colour of the Urine, without a Feaver; or red friable Sand ſticking to the bottom or ſides of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinal.</p>
                        <p>If the Scurvy be recent it admits of a Cure. If Inveterat, it requires a continued Uſe of proper Medicines for a long time; and frequently terminates in fatal Dropſies, Cachex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies, Obſtructions of the Bowels, or Conſumptions. If a difficulty of breathing attend it, 'tis very dangerous, and frequently finiſhes the Tragedy in a Swoon. Coſtiveneſs and ſuppreſſion of the Piles or wonted Evacuations are bad Omens. A weak and unequal Pulſe is leſs to be fear'd than in other Diſeaſes. Black Urine, without a Feaver, is well look'd upon, as being a ſign of the ſolution of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. Red Spots are a good Sign. But Black, Livid, or Blue ones and Ulcers are very bad. Night-ſweats with florid eruptions, frequently give relief. The Symptoms of a Scurvy are oft-times mutually exchang'd: Thus wand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring pains are ſhifted for a fix'd Head-Ache; the Colick and Convulſions for a Palſy, or inconſtant Swellings; grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:207638:166"/>pains for a Lethargy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A hot Scurvy, or ſuch as proceeds from bad Diet, and has fix'd Symptoms; is not eaſily Cur'd. A Looſeneſs attending a Scurvy is an unlucky Companion. In fine, all Prognoſtics relating to a Scurvy are very uncertain; for ſometimes diſmal Symptoms diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear on a ſudden, and meeker Signs are ſurpriz'd by Death.</p>
                        <p>The Cure of Hypocondriac and Scorbutical Diſeaſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in Correcting and Evacuating the Crudities of the firſt Paſſages, fortifying the Stomac, retrieving the due Craſis of the Blood, and reſtoring all wonted Evacuations to their former Courſe. In order to compaſs theſe ends, let the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Rules be heedfully minded.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Blood-letting and Iſſues are of no direct uſe. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times indeed, indirectly, a Scorbutical Catarrh may reap Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit from the latter; as the Head-ache and fix'd Pains in the Legs, may juſtifie the former.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Diuretics are always proper, and a plentiful evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Urine was ever obſerv'd to give relief. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Diſeaſe gentle Diuretics are beſt, for fear of draining the Morbifical cauſe out of the firſt Paſſages into the Veſſels. Such are the volatil and fix'd <hi>Alcali's, viz. Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Duplicatum,</hi> Spirit of Earth Worms, Tincture of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> Spirit of Sal-Armoniac, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Dry Vomits given in large Doſes, uſher'd in by Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtives; and in caſe of Coſtiveneſs, proper Clyſters; are the Baſis of the Cure of the Hypocondriac Diſeaſe. In a form'd Scurvy they are improper, as being apt to ſtir up and exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate the ſharp ſcorbutical Juices.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Purgatives waken the Symptoms of the Belly, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account are juſtly avoided. But Laxatives are very uſeful.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Attenuating Gums and other ſuch Ingredients, are always uſeful for cutting the viſcous Humours that give Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Hypocondriac Diſeaſes</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The Belly ought to be always kept open.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. When Aperients, by opening and unlocking the Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Bowels, cauſe a Flux or Dyſentery; let the Guts be corroborated by <hi>Elixir Proprietatis,</hi> Tincture of Coral, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">8. Chalybeats and dry Abſorbents are not always of equal uſe in the Hypocondriac Diſeaſe; for, if the Bowels are moleſted with hard Swellings, moiſt, liquid Aperients are preferable.</p>
                        <p n="9">
                           <pb n="332" facs="tcp:207638:167"/>9. Antiſcorbutics are uſeful againſt the Hypocondriac Diſeaſe as well as againſt the Scurvy.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. Bilious Conſtitutions, or ſuch as are rul'd by a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil ſharp Alcali, are oft-times offended by volatil Anti-ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butics, and oily Aromatics. Wherefore 'tis adviſable in that caſe, to qualifie the former with Spirit of Nitre or Whey; and ſhift the latter for meagre thin Salts, and Chalybeat Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbent Powders.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. Vinegar is pernicious. But the acid Juices of Fruits are allowable.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Volatil, ſharp Antiſcorbutics, ought always to be uſher'd in, and ſometimes interlac'd, with chalybeat Powders, or alcalin Salts.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. When the ſcorbutical Acid is corrected, and the Stomac able to digeſt, Milk mix'd with Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> or that of Scurvy-graſs, is of excellent uſe; it tempers the Acid, qualifies the ſharp Salt, and bedews the nervous parts. For Hypocondriac Perſons 'tis not ſo proper as Whey.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. Sweet Mercury is fitly mix'd with Laxatives for Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocondriacal Perſons; but 'tis pernicious to ſuch as are Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butical, tho' Antimony be very uſeful.</p>
                        <p>Having premis'd theſe cautionary Rules, we proceed to the Method of Cure. In which, digeſtive Preparatives lead the van. Such are Cetrach, Hyſſop, leſſer Centory, Saſſafras, Myrrh, China-root, and the fix'd Salts of Plants; Crabs-Eyes, Caſtor, Amber, Coral, Steel, and Abſorbent Chalybeat Powders; excepting the Powders of Stones par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of Steel, ſuch as Blood-ſtone, the Load-ſtone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſince the number of their aſtringent earthy parts ſurmounts that of the Chalybeat, and joins with the Acid in the firſt Paſſages into a ſtyptic Body, cauſing Coſtiveneſs. From the above mention'd Ingredients, we draw ſeveral Preparations, ſuch as the Extract of Steel; the tinctures of the Vitriol of Steel, of Tartar, and of the droſs of the <hi>Regulus</hi> of Antimony; The Hypocondriac Digeſtive Salt, (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> of the Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi>) Tartar vitriolated; the <hi>Terra Foliata</hi> of Tartar, (prepar'd by impregnating Salt of Tartar with Vinegar, then diſſolving it in ſpirit of Wine, and drawing off the Spirit) <hi>Poterius</hi>'s Antihectic, Chalybeat Bezoar, <hi>Elixir-Proprietatis</hi> prepar'd without an Acid, and eſpecially <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num duplicatum.</hi> For Example,</p>
                        <pb n="333" facs="tcp:207638:167"/>
                        <p>Take of Fennel and Mint-water, of each an Ounce and a half; the ſolution of Steel, with the Juice of Apples, half an Ounce; Magiſtery of Coral prepar'd with the Juice of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, a dram; Syrup of Orange-peel, ſix drams. Mix, and exhibit two or three ſpoonfuls Morning and Evening, for correcting a Hypocondriac Acid.</p>
                        <p>Take of the aperient Crocus of Steel, half a dram; <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canum duplicatum,</hi> a ſcruple; Salt of Wormwood, half a ſcruple. Make a Powder for three Doſes.</p>
                        <p>Take of the aperitive Tincture of Steel, two drams; Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Scurvy-graſs, a dram; Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> half a dram. Mix. Doſe fifty drops.</p>
                        <p>After theſe preparatives are us'd for a Week or two, 'tis time to adminiſter a Vomit of the Infuſion of <hi>Crocus Metallorum,</hi> mix'd with the Spirit of Scurvy-graſs. Or thus,</p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Dorncrellius</hi>'s Anti-ſcorbutic Water, two Ounces; ſpirit of Scurvy-graſs, half a dram; emetic Tartar, three or four grains; Extract of Steel, half a ſcruple. Mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Next in order are gentle Laxatives, eſpecially in a hot Scurvy; ſuch are the Pills of Ammoniac, or thoſe of Tartar mix'd with ſweet Mercury, which is of excellent uſe againſt Coſtiveneſs: For Reſinous Purgatives ought to be avoided, as being endow'd with an aſtringent quality. Wherefore Aloes, whoſe Gummy part is of good uſe, ought always to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd in a watry Vehicle, that ſo its Roſin may be ſeparated. Sometimes we mix Laxatives with Specific Alteratives, and continue their uſe for ſome time. And whet 'em if there be occaſion, with Coloquintida or Troches Alhandal. Raiſins, Prunes, Tamarinds, and ripe ſweet Apples, or their expreſs'd Juice, are of great efficacy againſt Coſtiveneſs: But Sugar and other ſweet things ought to be carefully avoided. Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb or Cream of Tartar, ſharpen'd with Powder of Jalap, are recommended to ſuch as are of a juicy Conſtitution. As for the forms of Receipts, they are as follows.</p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Quercetanus</hi>'s Pills, call'd <hi>Melanagogae,</hi> a Dram and a half; Extract of Senna Leaves, half a Dram; Roſin of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lap, a dram and ſix grains; Tartar vitriolated, thirteen grains; volatil ſalt of Amber, a ſcruple; the Seeds of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard, Scurvy-graſs and Garden Creſſes, of each half a dram. With ſome Antiſcorbutic Water, make Pills. This is the Compoſition of <hi>Timaeus</hi> his Antiſcorbutic Pills, of which, a ſcruple or half a dram is a Doſe.</p>
                        <pb n="334" facs="tcp:207638:168"/>
                        <p>Take of the Pills of Hiera with Agaric, twelve grains; Gum Ammoniac, diſſolv'd in Vinegar, half a ſcruple; Scammony ſulphurated, two grains. With the Eſſence of Steel make Pills.</p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Quercetanus</hi>'s Pills of Ammoniac, a ſcruple; ſweet Mercury, fifteen grains; Extract of Troches Alhandal, two grains; the diſtill'd Oyl of Caraways, two drops. With the Eſſence of Gum Ammoniac make Pills. The Vitriol of Steel calcin'd white, and the Extract of Steel prepar'd with Juice of Apples may be added by Turns. The Extract of black Hellebor is alſo a proper Baſis for Pills.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Aperitive Crocus of Steel, a ſcruple; Scam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony ſulphurated, and Salt of Tartar, of each five grains. Make a Powder.</p>
                        <p>Take of the freſh Leaves of Scurvy-graſs, Garden Creſſes, and Roſe-mary, of each a handful; freſh Horſe Radiſh Roots, an ounce and a half; pick'd Senna Leaves, an ounce; choice Rhubarb, half an ounce; Crude black Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebor, three drams; Juniper Berries, ſix drams; Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Galangal, of each a dram and a half; Salt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, three drams. Tye 'em in a Bag to be infus'd in Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood Wine, of which let the Patient take a draught Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Evening.</p>
                        <p>Take of Wormwood, three handfuls; leſſer Centory, two handfuls; black Hellebor Roots, three ounces; Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pody of the Oak, an ounce and a half; Bark of the Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree and white Tartar, of each half an ounce; filings of Steel, three drams. Sprinkle 'em with nine Drops of the dulcify'd Spirit of Nitre, and tye 'em in a Bag to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd in Wine.</p>
                        <p>Take of pick'd Senna Leaves, two drams; Polypody Roots, three drams; black Hellebor Roots, two ſcruples; Ginger, half a ſcruple; Salt of Tartar, a ſcruple; infuſe 'em for the ſpace of a Day in Whey, then boyl 'em gently. To three ounces of the ſtrain'd Liquor, add of the Spirit of Scurvy-graſs, a ſcruple; Syrup of Apples, three drams; Mix for one Doſe.</p>
                        <p>Take of Corants, two ounces; Bruiſe and boyl them in Water; adding while the Water is yet hot, pickt Senna Leaves, three drams; Violet Flowers, three little handfuls; Cream of Tartar, a dram. Let 'em ſtand for ſome time in a hot place, then ſtrain the Liquor for uſe.</p>
                        <pb n="335" facs="tcp:207638:168"/>
                        <p>Take of the Pulp of Corants, three ounces; <hi>Arcanum Duplicatum,</hi> a dram; purify'd <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> and the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der call'd <hi>Diatrion Pipereon,</hi> of each two Scruples. With the Syrup of Apples make an Electuary for nine or twelve Doſes.</p>
                        <p>After Purgatives we ſubjoyn Emollient abſtergent Clyſters; eſpecially thoſe of Carminative Ingredients boyl'd in Childs Urine, againſt Hypochondriac pains in the Belly; thoſe of Milk and Turpentine, againſt Nephritic pains; and thoſe of Whey or rather of Milk injected every other Day in a confirm'd Scurvy. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of Cows Milk, nine ounces; Lenitive Electuary, an ounce; Electuary of Bay-Berries, half an ounce. With the yelk of one Egg, make a Clyſter to be injected at Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and retain'd all Night. Some inject the Decoction of Elder Flowers and Henbane Leaves in Milk, againſt Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butical Pains.</p>
                        <p>The Patient's Body being thus prepar'd we advance to Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives. Such are Steel and all fix'd Salts, or whatever ſubdues an Acid. To theſe we joyn either the Aperients, Diuretics, and bitter Stomachical Aromatics, or the Spirituous volatil Salts. Thus the filings of Steel, all its Aperitive Crocus's, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol of Steel calcin'd, the ſolar Liquor of Steel, the natural Spaws conſiſting of Steel diſſolv'd in Sulphur, the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the vitriol of Steel, the ſolution of Steel prepar'd with the juice of ſweet Apples and mix'd with the Spirit of Scurvy-graſs, Chalybeat <hi>Diaphoretic Antimony,</hi> Chaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat Bezoar, the Bezoar Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe I ſay are all of good uſe. But when the Bowels are ſtuff'd or threaten'd with hard ſwellings they are improper. Beſides while Spaw Waters are drunk, 'twill be requiſite to defend the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac by ſome Stomachical Ointment or Plaiſter.</p>
                        <p>Next to Steel are the bitter Plants, dedicated to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac and Spleen; ſuch are Fumitory, leſſer Centory, Juniper Barries, Wormwood, Agrimony, Cuckow-pint, and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campane: Their Decoctions, Eſſences, and above all their fix'd Salts, and the Salt taken from the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> of the Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac. Mynſichtius</hi>'s <hi>Arcanum Dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum</hi> is of excellent uſe, eſpecially when the Perſon is lyable to fluſhings and ſudden Inflammations. <hi>Elixyr Proprietatis</hi> prepar'd without an Acid, and mix'd with the Spirit of Scurvy-graſs and that of <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi> is alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. The volatil Salt and Spirit of Tartar; the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Tartar mix'd with the Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> and
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:207638:169"/>given to forty Drops; the Garminative Spirit prepar'd from Tartar, Nitre, and Spirit of Wine; the Spirit diſtill'd from a Mixture of Quick-lime, Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi> and Spirit of Wine impregnated with Aromatics; the Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> mix'd with Antiſcorbutic Spirits; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the Liquor of the <hi>Terra Foliata</hi> of Tartar, mix'd with Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac;</hi> are very much approv'd both in the Hypocondriac and Scorbutical Diſtemper, eſpecially when the Perſon is lyable to Heats and Fluſhings, and apt to be offended by the Oily Aromatic Ingredients: In which caſe purify'd or Antimonial Nitre is alſo uſeful. Nay ſome are very diffuſe in their Encomium's upon a mixture of Nitre, and the Powder <hi>Diacumini.</hi> The forms of Alterative Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipe's are ſuch as theſe following.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Conſerve of Fumitory, an ounce and a half; Confection <hi>Alchermes,</hi> a dram and a half; Crude Steel pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veris'd, three drams; Magiſtery of Coral prepar'd with the Juice of Citrons, a dram. With the Syrup of Apples, make an Electuary.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Eſſence of Gum Ammoniac, half an ounce; Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi> mix'd with Oyl of Saſſafras, two drams. Doſe fifty drops.</p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Elixyr Proprietatis,</hi> prepar'd without an Acid, half an ounce; Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi> mix'd with Oyl of Cloves, two drams; Spirit of Scurvy-graſs, a dram and a half. Doſe forty drops thrice a Day.</p>
                        <p>Take of Fumitory Water, two ounces; Borrage and Bugloſs Waters, of each an ounce; Carminative Spirit <hi>de tribus,</hi> two drams; prepar'd red Coral, a dram; Syrup of red Poppies, half an ounce. Mix and exhibit a ſpoonful now and then in the Hypochondriacal Fit.</p>
                        <p>The Specifics that are peculiarly devoted to the Scurvy, are of two ſorts. 1. Such are the volatil ſharp Ingredients that amend the indiſpoſition of the Blood. 2. Balmy Oily Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines that repair the loſſes of the ſolid and nervous Paſts. Of the firſt ſort are Scurvy-graſs, Marſh Trefoyl, Water Creſſes, Celandin, Pilewort, the Herb call'd Trinity, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmart eſpecially its diſtill'd Water, Horſe Radiſhes, Muſtard-ſeeds, and thoſe of Garden Creſſes, Rockets, Scurvy-graſs, and Columbines. To theſe we add the Juice of Sorrel, Citrons, Oranges and ſuch like Acids, to temper the vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til ſharpneſs that frequently offends young hot Conſtitutions. Of the latter ſort are the Buds and Bark of the Pine or Fir Tree, the Pine Apple, or Pine Wood, Saſſafras, Guajacum,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:207638:169"/>China Roots, Juniper Wood, Winter Cinnamon; the Rinds of the Aſh-tree, Tamarisk, Citrons and Oranges; Water Germander, Fumitory, Wormwood, Elecampane, Zedoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Galangal, Angelica, Lovage, the Fruit of the Knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry-buſh and its Electuary, Cacao Nuts; the flowers of Broom, St. <hi>John</hi>'s wort, Elder and Saffron; Earth-worms, and Gooſe Dung given to a dram in Wine,</p>
                        <p>The Antiſcorbutics of the former ſort being volatil, wo'nt admit of Decoction. Upon which account we chooſe to infuſe 'em in Wine for Cold, in Whey for Bilious, and in Milk for dry wither'd Conſtitutions. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of freſh Scurvy-graſs, Fumitory and Water-creſſes, of each a handful; Horſe Radiſh Roots, three ounces; freſh Elecampane Roots, an ounce; Corants, ſix drams. Cut, bruiſe, and tye them in a Bag, to be infus'd in Wine, Whey, or Milk, of which exhibit a draught thrice a Day. If they be infus'd in Wine, 'twill be proper to add half a dram of Crabs-eyes to every draught, for preventing the bad effects of the acidity that prevails in Wine.</p>
                        <p>Take of freſh Scurvy-graſs and Water-creſſes, of each a handful; Elecampane Roots, an ounce and a half; Acorus Roots, an ounce; Shavings of Saſſafras, and Filings of Steel, of each two ounces; Orange-peel, Citron-peel, and Galan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, of each two drams. Tye 'em in a Bag as above. If we deſire to render 'em Purgative, we add Senna Leaves, black Hellebor, Rhubarb, and Salt of Tartar.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Juices of Scurvy-graſs, Water-creſſes, and Fumitory, of each three ounces; Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>ons and Wood-ſorrel, of each two ounces; clarify'd Goats-whey, three pound. Let 'em ſtand till they become clear, then ſtrain the Liquor, and give five ounces for a Doſe twice a Day, adding to every Draught a convenient quantity of the Eſſence of Steel, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with the Juice of Apples.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Chalybeat Cachectic Powder, two drams; Cuckow-pint Roots, and <hi>Arcanum Duplicatum,</hi> of each a dram; diſtill'd Oyl of Scurvy-graſs, eight drops. Make a Powder.</p>
                        <p>From the above-mentioned Simples we draw Spirits. Firſt by Fermentation, then by frequent Cohobation upon freſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients. Theſe Spirits digeſted with the extract of Steel, or with the extract and thicken'd juice of the other Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, yield noble antiſcorbutic Eſſences, that are given from half a dram to a dram. To theſe we frequently joyn the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd Oyls of the ſame Plants, and the volatil Spirits of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:207638:170"/>eſpecially the Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> and that of Earth-Worms.</p>
                        <p>Of the balmy Antiſcorbutics that are calculated for the diſorder of the Nerves and ſolid parts, Saſſafras, China Roots, the wild Pine-tree, and the Pine-apple are the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Buds of the wild Pine-tree, two ounces; China Roots ſliced, an ounce; infuſe 'em in two pounds of Ale, and boyl 'em till the half evaporat. Exhibit a draught of the ſtrain'd Liquor warm, Morning and Evening, in order to ſweat. Juniper-berries, Fir-tops, and Raiſins, are alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Antiſcorbutics.</p>
                        <p>The extract of Juniper-berries, or the thicken'd decoction of the Pine-apple, reduc'd to Eſſences with the Spirit of Scurvy-graſs, are admirable for this purpoſe, being given from forty to fifty drops. But withal we ought to take notice, that all Remedies prepar'd from the Pine-tree are enrich'd with a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful volatil Oyl that dejects the Appetit, and if too long us'd cauſes Feavers, Puſhes, or cuticular Eruptions in young Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                        <p>But both the Indications of ſubduing the ſcorbutical Acid, and relieving the ſolid parts, are admirably accounted for by a Milk diet. The time of exhibiting Milk, is after the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Evacuations, and the uſe of Steel. Goats Milk is accounted the beſt, and for thoſe who are feaveriſh we chooſe Whey. If the Patient be of a lean dry Conſtitution, and if the ſcorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Acid be fiery and ſharp, Milk alone is beſt: But other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we boyl antiſcorbutical Ingredients in the Milk, or add their Juices and Spirits. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of Goat's Whey a quart, and boyl it in a cloſe Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel with a handful of freſh Fumitory leaves. Then ſtrain it, and add to every draught twenty drops of the Spirit of Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy-graſs, and a little Sugar to prevent its curdling. Thus let the Patient continue the uſe of it for ſome time, interlacing a laxative every fourth day, remembring always to walk after taking it, in order to promote Urin, and abſtain from Wine and acid Liquors. This method of infuſing or boyling antiſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buticks in Milk, ought to be follow'd during the Spring and Summer; but in the Autumn Wine is the more proper Vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</p>
                        <p>The general Cure of the Scurvy being thus diſpatch'd, it remains to account for its particular Symptoms. Theſe are,</p>
                        <p n="1">I. The Laxity, Swelling, Bleeding, Ulceration, or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifaction of the Gums. For removing ſuch Inconveniencies,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:207638:170"/>we uſe Gargariſms, Tinctures, Powders, and Ointments. The Gargariſms are made of the juice of Sage and Scurvy-graſs; or the Decoction of Sage and Scurvy-graſs, in Milk, Whey, or Wine. Or of Privat-wood, Pine-tree tops, Creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Allum; in Milk, Whey, or Wine. To which we add by turns, Snake-weed Roots, Tormentil, Birthwort, Myrrh, <hi>Lac,</hi> Spirit of Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As,</p>
                        <p>Take of Sage-leaves, three handfuls; Scurvy-graſs and Water-creſſes, of each half a handful; Flowers of Mallows, two handfuls; Polipody Roots ſix drams. Boyl them in two pound of fair Water till the half be conſum'd. Then ſtrain the Liquor, and add of the Hony of Roſes, an ounce and a half; burnt Allum, a dram; purify'd Nitre, three drams; ſeal'd Earth, and <hi>Florentin Lac,</hi> of each a dram. Mix for a Gargariſm. If the Gums are putrify'd, boyl Leſſer Centory, Plantan, Savin, Water Germander, Roſes, Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort Roots, and Maſtic, in auſtere Wine; and add to a pound and a half of the ſtrain'd Decoction, an ounce and a half of the Ointment <hi>Aegyptiacum,</hi> and a dram and a half of crude Allum.</p>
                        <p>Take of Plantan, Self-heal, and Roſe-water, of each four Ounces; Tincture of Roſes, Spirit of Scurvy-graſs, of each two drams; Spirit of Salt, Spirit of Vitriol, of each a ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Mix and rub the Gums.</p>
                        <p>After Gargariſing the Mouth, 'tis proper to rub the Gums with Tinctures, eſpecially <hi>Mynſichtius</hi> his Tincture of <hi>Lac,</hi> which may be improv'd by adding Myrrh, and ſhifting the Phlegm of Allum for that of Vitriol. The following Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture is alſo very effectual, <hi>viz.</hi> Pour warm Water upon Quick-lime, and boyl it, then let it ſtand till it be clear, and ſtrain it. Draw off this ſtrain'd Lye till a Salt remain at bottom. Now take of this Salt three drams; of the Gum <hi>Lac,</hi> two drams; Cyprus Vitriol, ſix Grains; Roſemary and Sage-waters, of each an ounce and a half. Mix, and diſſolve with a gentle heat.</p>
                        <p>As for Powders; Take of Snake-weed, and Tormentil Roots, and the Rinds of Pomegranats, of each a dram; Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, Frankincenſe, Burnt-allum, and <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> of each half a dram; make a Powder for rotten Gums. Or ſprinkle it with the diſtill'd Oyl of Cloves, and Spirit of Scurvy-graſs. Note, all ſtony or tartarin things are pernicious to the Gums.</p>
                        <p>If the Mouth or Gums are beſet with Ulcers, apply the following Liniment. Take of crude Allum, a dram and a half; Sage-leaves, three drams; Roots of Florentin Orris,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:207638:171"/>a dram and a half; Myrrh, half a dram. With Hony make a Liniment. <hi>Borellus</hi> recommends Allum, with the Oyl of Sulphur and Conſerve of Roſes. If the Ulcers are malignant and ſtinking, apply the Ointment of Columbines, with the Juice of Sage, and Spirit of Salt; or the Ointment <hi>Aegyptiacum</hi> diluted with Hony, or <hi>Platerus</hi>'s green Waters. Note, the Spirit of Vitriol always makes the Teeth black.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Scorbutical Tooth-aches are cur'd by applying the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Pine-tree Leaves with Spirit of Scurvy-graſs; or the Juices of leſſer Houſe-leek and Scurvy-graſs, with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Henbane, Roſemary, Rue, Plantane, Sage, Snake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weed and Fearn. If the Pain reach the Temples and Face, foment 'em with the weaker Spirit of Scurvy-graſs, mix'd with the Spirit of Earth-worms.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. The ſpots on the Skin ought to be promoted by exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting inwardly the volatil Specifics, mix'd with abſorbent Powders, and the Tincture of Columbine Flowers, or Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of its Seed, or the Antiſcorbutical Tincture of Coral. If the Spots be red, we add acid Juices; if blew or livid, Scurvy-graſs and volatil Ingredients. Externally if they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order the Skin, and are apt to excoriat, apply, after ſweating, a Liniment of Muſtard-ſeeds mix'd with Vinegar; or, if that be too ſharp, with the Oyl of ſweet Almonds, and freſh Juice of Citrons. The Ointment of the Roots of Florentin Orris, and white Hellebor, mix'd with the Oyl of ſweet Almonds, is look'd upon by ſome as infallible for this purpoſe. If the Skin itch, and be moleſted with little miliar Eruptions, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the Decoction of Pine-tree Buds; and let the Hands and Feet be lick'd by a Dog.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. The fix'd pains in the Legs are remov'd by bleeding in the Arm; applying Bliſtering Plaiſters near the affected part; exhibiting Sudorifics, eſpecially the Decoctions of Woods and Pine-tree Buds, the Eſſence of Saſſafras, Spirit of Scurvy-graſs, Spirit of Venice Treacle camphoris'd, and Spirit of Elder-berries mix'd with the Eſſence of Opium and <hi>Laudanum Opiatum;</hi> and by fomenting the part with the Spirit of Juniper-beries camphoris'd, Spirit of Earth-worms, and <hi>Aqua Articularis;</hi> or by ſoaking it in Tanner's Lye, mix'd with Man's Urine; or in hot fermenting Wine; or in the Decoction of Ants; the Perſon being put to a warm Bed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after. Some recommend the Decoction of Sage, Chamomil and Elder-flowers, Water-creſſes, and Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane-leaves, in Milk or Whey for a fomentation; or the
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:207638:171"/>Rob of Juniper, mix'd with the thicken'd Juices of Water-creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Camomil and Elder Flowers, in the form of a Cataplaſm; or hot dry Bags of Millet-Seeds, Salt, Bran, Wormwood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tops, and Chamomil Flowers; to be applied to the Parts; however, if all prove ineffectual, we muſt have recourſe to the natural Hot Baths, or Artificial ones of Sulphur and Quick-lime.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. The Colick Pains, or thoſe reſembling the Nephritic, as proceeding from the Cramp and Convulſion of the Guts and the Meſentery (which is ſeated in the Loins) are Cur'd by cleanſing the Guts, and appeaſing the tumultuous motions. The firſt deſign is compaſs'd by Raiſins, Goats-Whey, Oyl of ſweet Almonds, and the Decoction of Marſh-mallows. Pugatives are very pernicious. But, if the Pain be recent, and not very violent, we may venture to exhibit a gentle Purge, mix'd with <hi>Opium,</hi> the Body being firſt prepar'd by Digeſtives. If the irritating matter be hot and ſharp, Whey, in which <hi>China</hi>-Roots, Borrage-Flowers, and Clove-Gilli-flowers are boil'd, the Emulſions of cold Seeds, Sugar of Lead, or the Antiphthiſical Tincture, and earthy abſorbent Powders are proper; but if the Urine be laden with a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Tartar, all Lenitives are in vain 'till that be remov'd by meek Diuretics, ſuch as Turpentin, the Syrup of Marſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In other caſes we exhibit the Volatil oily Salts, mix'd with Opiats, eſpecially the Spirit of Nitre dulcifi'd with the Spirit of Scurvy-graſs, the carminative Spirit <hi>de tribus,</hi> and the Spirit of Earth-Worms. Or thus,</p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Dorncrellius</hi> his Carminative Water, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſcorbutic Water, of each two Ounces; the Spirit of Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy-graſs, and the carminative Spirit <hi>de tribus,</hi> of each a dram; the Eſſence of <hi>Opium,</hi> half a dram; Syrup of Orange-peel, an Ounce.</p>
                        <p>Emollient Anodyn Clyſters, are alſo very proper; I mean ſuch as are uſually preſcrib'd againſt Colic and Nephritic Pains, eſpecially thoſe of the Decoction of River-Crabs. But if they do not quickly give relief, 'tis adviſable to ſet 'em aſide, for fear of inflaming the Guts, and to foment the Belly with the Decoctions deſign'd for 'em. 'Tis alſo uſual to anoint the Navel with the Oyl diſtill'd from <hi>Galbanum</hi> and Turpentin, and then apply either a hot Brick, or the Plaiſter of <hi>Galbanum,</hi> mix'd with the Balſam of <hi>Peru. P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>'s Plaiſter <hi>Diaſulphuris</hi> applied to the Loins, is of good
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:207638:172"/>uſe; as alſo Fomentations, or Cataplaſms for the Belly, of Chamomil and Elder-flowers, Juniper Berries, Henbane-leaves, Creſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> boil'd in Milk. If the Clyſters prove ſucceſsful, let 'em be ſtill continu'd, and ſharpen'd with purgative In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients; after the Paroxiſm, exhibit the Decoction of Pine-Apples and Juniper Berries, and other Antiſcorbutics.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. The wandring gouty Pains that follow the Scurvy, are owing to the Convulſive influence of the ſcorbutical Salt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the nervous Parts, eſpecially the Membranes that cover the Bones. They are diſtinguiſh'd from a proper Gout, by theſe Symptoms. They are very inconſtant, and apt to ſhift the place of their Abode, and return again on a ſudden. Thus rubbing with a warm Cloth will occaſion their remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val and appearance in another Part. They never riſe up in hard ſtubborn Swellings. Their ſolution is frequently accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd by Sweat and Urine; and by cuticular Eruptions, with an unſufferable itching. The Cure conſiſts in allaying the impeutoſity of the Spirits and Humors, evacuating the Scorbutic Salt by Sweat and Urine, and removing the radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal cauſe after the Paroxyſm is over.</p>
                        <p>Firſt of all, it ought to commence by bleeding in the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſide to the part affected; then Clyſters and Vomits, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by abſorbent Powders and fix'd Salts, eſpecially <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Duplicatum,</hi> diaphoretic Antimony, and Cinnabar of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony; to which if the Spirits be very irregular, we add Narcotics. Oft-times a gentle Laxative is very neceſſary. If the Spirits be low and flaggy, we may exhibit the Eſſence of Woods, or <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle, with Oſteocal mix'd with <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi> After theſe Preparations, we proceed to the uſe of volatil Specifics; of which Worms are the Head. The Spirit of putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd Earth-worms, rectifi'd upon <hi>Cephalic</hi> Plants, or the Infuſion of bruis'd Worms, in Wine, Milk, or Whey, are moſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Medicaments. Some apply living Worms to the Part, which die if the Pain be violent, and as the Symptoms re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, prolong their life. Therefore this Application is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd till the Worms ceaſe to die. When the Paroxyſm declines, we endeavour to root out the radical Cauſe, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations from the Pine-Tree, <hi>China</hi> Roots, and Juniper-Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries mix'd with Antiſcorbutics. The Decoction of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood and leſſer Centory; Bags of Antiſcorbutical Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents infus'd in Wine; and the carminative Spirit, or Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> mix'd with the Spirit of Scurvy-graſs, are all of good uſe. In a Word, if the Patient be of a moiſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:207638:172"/>and apt to ſweat, volatil Ingredients are beſt; if not, Milk, eſpecially Goats Milk, or Whey, in which ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Antiſcorbutical Ingredients are boyl'd, is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                        <p>Take of Cinnabar of Antimony, a ſcruple; <hi>Poterius</hi>'s dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoretic Gold, twelve grains; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> two grains. Make a Powder to be exhibited in the beginning of the Diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Water of Mother of Thyme, Pine-Apples, and Scurvy-graſs, of each an ounce; the Eſſence againſt Catarrhs, three drams; the ſpirit of putrifi'd Earth-Worms, a dram; the volatil ſalt of Harts-horn, a ſcruple; the volatil ſalt of Amber, half a ſcruple; prepar'd Crabs Eyes, half a dram; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> three grains; Syrup of Elecam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pane Roots, an Ounce. Mix, and give a Spoonful, in order to ſweat.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Buds of the wild Pine-Tree, three ounces; <hi>China</hi> Roots ſlic'd, an ounce and a half; Juniper Berries, an ounce. Boil them in Water; and exhibit four ounces in order to ſweat every Morning, and as much at Night without ſweating.</p>
                        <p>Externally we ought to avoid all oily Applications. Let the part be forcibly rub'd with a Cloth outwards, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Circumference; and fumigated with the ſteams of the Decoction of Earth-worms and Ants. Then apply Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſms of Horſe-Radiſh Roots, or Briony Roots, boil'd with Camomil Flowers, and Comfrey Roots in Milk; or of Cats Dung and Earth-Worms; or of <hi>Venice</hi> Soap, diſſolv'd in Spirit of Wine, ſprinkl'd with the Spirit of Earth-worms, and mix'd with Camphyr; but 'tis worthy our notice, that theſe Cataplaſms ought to be always kept warm, for if they grow cold upon the Part, they wring and ſtraiten its Pores. Upon which account, ſome chooſe rather to foment it with the Spirit of putrifi'd Earth-worms, Spirit of Ants, the Spirit of Juniper Berries camphoris'd, or the Spirit of Wine impregnated with Aromatic Plants; and then apply a Plaiſter of Tacamahac, and <hi>Mynſichtius</hi>'s Diaphoretic Plaiſter.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Scorbutical Head-aches are cur'd by volatil Sudori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſics, ſuch as the volatil Salt of Amber, Spirit of Harts-horn, the Cephalic Spirit of Vitriol, the Anti-ſcorbutical <hi>Elixir Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietatis,</hi> and ſometimes Opiats. To theſe we ſubjoin a Milk Diet, which, tho' noxious in other Caſes, is of admirable efficacy in this.</p>
                        <p n="8">
                           <pb n="344" facs="tcp:207638:173"/>VIII. A ſcorbutical Palſie is, for the moſt part, uſher'd in by a ſenſe of a creeping ſort of Pain, like the motion of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets. 'Tis Cur'd thus; adminiſter a Vomit, unleſs the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be liable to Pains in the Belly. Avoid Bleeding, unleſs the Perſon be Plethorick; inject emollient Clyſters, and exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit the mildeſt Laxatives. Then order the Decoction of Juniper and Pine-tree-wood, or the Pine Apple, with Roſemary and cephalic Plants, in Milk or Whey. The Decoctions of ſudori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic Woods, the Eſſence of the Pine Apple, the Eſſence of Juniper Berries, the volatil Spirit of Tartar, or the Carmina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Spirit <hi>de tribus,</hi> mix'd with the Spirit of Scurvy-graſs; the volatil Salt of Amber, and eſpecially <hi>Poterius</hi>'s diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Gold, or fulminatory Gold, are all recommended upon this occaſion. Externally the ſame Medicines are requir'd, as we order for the wandring Gout, eſpecially the Spirit of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niper Berries, Eſſence of Caſtor, Spirit of Earth-worms. Some order the Perſon to be ſet up to the Waſte in a Heap of Grapes, while they ferment either naturally, or by the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Quicklime; Cataplaſms of Briony and Comfrey Roots, are oft us'd with good ſucceſs; ſome fumigate the Part with the ſteams of Gooſe-fat thrown upon burning Coals; and anoint it with the Oil of Scurvy-graſs, the Oil, or Spirit of Earth-worms, diſtill'd Oil of Amber, and Balſam of <hi>Peru.</hi> Some apply Plaiſters, ſuch as <hi>Oxycroceum</hi> and <hi>Nervinum Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonis;</hi> but all oily things are improper, by reaſon that they ſhut the Pores. Of the natural hot Baths, thoſe of the meekeſt force and heat are beſt.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. Scorbutical Convulſions are cur'd by Vomits, Purges, and Antiſcorbutics, mix'd with nervous Ingredients, <hi>Lac,</hi> Cinnabar of Antimony, the volatil Salt of Amber, and Camphyr, exhibited in the Decoction of Elecampane and Juniper Berries, are of excellent uſe. Some recommend Caſtle-Soap diſſolv'd in Milk; as alſo the Eſſence of the Pine-Apple, the Eſſence of Saſſafras, carminative Spirit, and Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi> mix'd with the Spirit of Scurvy-graſs and <hi>Laudanum.</hi> In the laſt extremity, we muſt have recourſe to the Decoctions of ſudorific Woods, China Roots, and Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel. Externally, the Oil diſtill'd from a mixture of Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and Oil of Lin-ſeed is of noted efficacy; and likewiſe all cephalic Spirits and Oils. Some recommend Bathing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Day for eight Hours, in the Decoctions of Gentian, Juniper-Berries, Rue, and Agrimony.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. Aſthma's attending the Scurvy are cur'd by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of Saffron; ſpirits of Hart's-horn, Caſtor, Amber, and
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:207638:173"/>
                           <hi>Sal-Armoniac;</hi> Benzoin, and Birth-wort-Roots, with Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcorbutical Decoctions. If the Aſthma's are merely Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive, <hi>Laudanum Hyſtericum</hi> is a ſovereign Remedy.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. Vomitings require Artificial Vomits, gentle Purges, and ſtomachical Medicines, mix'd with abſorbent Powders, and Antiſcorbutics. Looſeneſſes are cur'd after the ſame me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, rather than by Aſtringents, which frequently occaſion Anxieties in the Breaſt, and Swoonings, Bleedings at Noſe, or any other part, are beſt ſtopp'd by exhibiting inwardly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeat Aſtringents, ſuch as Chalybeat, Diaphoretic Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, Vitriol of Steel, the Antiphthiſical Tincture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="12">XII. A ſcorbutical Conſumption is generally accounted for by a Milk Diet, which is of excellent uſe, when it proceeds from the degeneracy of the Blood. But if the diſorders of the Stomac and firſt Paſſages gave Birth to it, Milk is improper, and is fitly exchanged for Vomits and ſtomachical Aromatics. In general, <hi>Elixir Proprietatis</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Acid, the ſpirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniae,</hi> the Antiphthiſical Tincture, and Raiſins eaten after Meals, are very proper. If the Animal Spirits are flat, nervous Remedies will be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. If the milky Veſſels, or Glandules of the Meſentery and other Parts are charg'd with Obſtructions, volatil Ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rients are neceſſary.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. Scorbutical Fevers take their Original from the Corroſive ſharpneſs of the Blood, and generally paſs for Hectics. Their Symptoms are an exceſſive Appetit, follow'd by Vomiting, or love for ſalt Victuals; Coſtiveneſs, Sweats, ſmelling like Acids, and leaving red Sand in the Bed, and livid Spots in the Skin. They are cur'd by Antiſcorbutics mix'd with Steel, and volatil and fix'd Salts, eſpecially the Flowers and ſpirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> the Spirit of Saſſafras, and <hi>Arcanum Duplicatum;</hi> Whey ſharpen'd with the Juice of Citrons is much approv'd, as alſo Milk, mix'd with the Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> when the Stomac is able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt it, and the Feaveriſh Paroxyſm is over. The Symptom of Thirſt is admirably accounted for by exhibiting the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of China-roots and Liquorice.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. In ſcorbutical Dropſies, ſtrong Purgatives are nox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious; gentle Diuretics mix'd with Antiſcorbutics, being the Baſis of the Cure. Such are the Infuſion of Wood-lice in Wine, the Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> and Tincture of Tartar, mix'd with the Spirit of Scurvy-Graſs.</p>
                        <p n="15">XV. St. <hi>Antony</hi>'s Fire happening to ſcorbutical Perſons, is cur'd by taking inwardly abſorbent diaphoretic Powders,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:207638:174"/>mix'd with the Spirit or Syrup of Elder-Flowers, and Spirit of Scurvy-graſs; and applying outwardly the Decoction of Litharge, Elder-Flowers, <hi>Olibanum,</hi> Myrrh and Maſtic, in Lime-water and Vinegar, with a little Camphyr.</p>
                        <p n="16">XVI. Ulcers accompanying the Scurvy, and threatning a Gangrene, ought to be waſh'd with Lime-Water, or the Decoction of leſſer Houſe-leek, mix'd with the Spirit of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, and anointed with the Ointment of Tobacco and Sugar of Lead; or cover'd with the Powders of Myrrh, and Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincenſe, Crocus of Steel, and Sugar of Lead. Inwardly let the Eſſence of Woods, Eſſence of Fumitory, and the Antiſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butical Tincture of Coral be frequently adminiſtred. As for the hard Swellings that frequently moleſt the Legs; let Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſms of Bryony and Comfrey-Roots, and Chamomil Flowers, be applied to 'em. Or let the thicken'd Juices of Comfrey and Brook-lime, mix'd with <hi>Mynſichtius</hi> his Diaphoretic Plaiſter, and the Diſtill'd Oil of Chamomil be us'd in like manner.</p>

                        <p>UNder the Head of <hi>Deprav'd Nutrition,</hi> we allot an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle for Cuticular Eruptions; and firſt for the Scab, which proceeds from the depravation of the nutritive Juice of the Parts under the Skin, occaſion'd by a preternatural Acid. This Acid takes its riſe from ſudden Cold, ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Heat; and ſhutting up the ſteams of the Body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſtraiten'd Pores; from the contagion of an external Ferment, and ſometimes, but very rarely, from internal Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſuch as the Scurvy, <hi>French-Pox,</hi> &amp;c. But, for the moſt part, the Blood and Internal Parts are not at all tainted, it being only the nutritive Serum about the ſurface of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that is depraved; tho' 'tis true, that by continuance it may at laſt infect the Blood. If the nutritious Juice be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſerous and apt to corrupt, the Breakings-out run much; if the Juice be Balmy, and impregnated with a volatil oily Salt; they are cruſty and dry.</p>
                        <p>As for the Cure of a Scab; we adminiſter inwardly Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives and Sudorifics. The Purgatives are the Extract of Black Hellebor, or Scammony ſulphurated, mix'd with ſweet Mercury, and the purging <hi>Mercurius vitae,</hi> or Turbith
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:207638:174"/>Mineral in an inveterat caſe. If the Blood be tainted, we adminiſter the Decoctions of bitter and ſcorbutical Plants, and Spices mix'd with purging Ingredients, in Wine, Whey, or Water, and continue their uſe for ſome time. The Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorifics are the Decoctions of Woods, the volatil Salt of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, Harts-horn, Ivory; the fix'd Salts, the Sulphur and Cinnabar of Antimony, diaphoretick Antimony, and the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of Elder Flowers. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of Elder-Flower Water, an ounce; the Spirit of <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle camphoris'd, half a Dram; Diaphoretic Antimony, fifteen Grains; the volatil Salt of Vipers, half a Scruple; Syrup of Orange-peel, half an ounce. Mix for a Draught. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Rob of Elder, a dram; the Powder of Snakes calcin'd, a ſcruple; <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> half a ſcruple. With the Syrup of Orange-peel make a Bolus. The diſtill'd Oyl of Turpentin given to ſix Drops every Morning; the Eſſence of Vipers to forty; the Tincture of Antimony, or Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Coral, given to fifty Drops, are alſo very proper. And when all proves ineffectual, a Mercurial Salivation may not be amiſs.</p>
                        <p>Outwardly we apply Ointments of Sulphur, Mercury, eſpecially that precipitated with the Spirit of Nitre, and Sugar of Lead; but we ought to take care that the Pores be kept open, for fear the Scab ſhould ſtrike in. Upon which account, let Salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> be always added. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>

                        <p>Take of the Decoction of Quick-lime, a pound and a half; ſweet Mercury, three drams; Spirit of <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle camphoris'd, an ounce. Mix, and waſh the external Parts, for taking off the Scab, and the red Scars that remain after it.</p>
                        <p>The Diſtill'd Water of Man's Ordure, is an admirable Waſh, and reſerv'd by ſome as a Secret. Some uſe Girdles of Quick-ſilver; others fumigate with Cinnabar; but the Body ought to be well cleans'd beforehand, and arm'd againſt
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:207638:175"/>Cold. In a critical Scab, we ought not to uſe repellents. But Baths of the Decoctions of the ſharp pointed Dock, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco-Leaves, Scabious, Elecampane and Briony Roots, Brimſtone, and Quick-lime are allowable. After ſweating by internal Sudorifics, the ſcabby Perſon may bath in them, and rub down his Body, and after bathing, anoint with the above-mention'd Ointment.</p>
                        <p>The Itch is near ally'd to the Scab, and proceeds from the ſharp Particles of the Serum, repairing to the ſurface in ſmall quantities; 'tis cur'd internally by purging and ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as above; and externally by applying the following Ointment.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Roots of the ſharp pointed Dock, and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campane, of each an ounce. Boil them in Vinegar 'till they become ſoft; then beat 'em thro' a Sive, and add of the Oyl of <hi>Orris,</hi> three Ounces; common Salt an Ounce; Myrrh, three Drams; Litharge, an ounce and a half. With Wax make a Liniment.</p>
                        <p>A Leproſie proceeds from a ſaline corroſive Acid, reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Serum; as being a ſort of exalted Scurvy. It is oft-times the hereditary Infirmity of a Family, or follows a bad Dyet, Chronical Diſeaſes, and the ſuppreſſion of wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Evacuations. The Signs which accompany it, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther internal or external. The internal are Acid or muſty Belchings, Coſtiveneſs, Thirſt, a ſtinking Sweat, thick U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, inſomuch that the Powder of Lead will ſwim upon it, an extreme propenſity to Venery; the thickneſs, viſcoſity, and unctuoſity of the Blood when drawn forth, and little Clotts of Sand ſticking to the Cloth, thro' which 'tis ſtrain'd; the frequency and weakneſs of the Pulſe, difficult reſpiration, ſtinking Breath, a wearineſs of the Limbs, Chillneſs, ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and a hoarſe Voice, as if it came thro' the Noſe.</p>
                        <p>The External Symptoms are theſe. The Skin appears Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Black, or Yellow; it Wrinkles, when expos'd to the Cold; it is notably rough and oily, inſomuch that Water will not ſtick to it; it is cover'd with a Purple or White Dandriff; little moveable painleſs Knots and Swellings beſet the Forehead, Chin and Joints; a dry Ringworm, and Puſhes cover the whole Body; and affect not only the Skin, but the Muſcles; an eternal Itch, like the gnawing of Worms, or pricking with Needles, moleſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="349" facs="tcp:207638:175"/>ſwell'd, the Eyebrows callous and rais'd; their Eyes round, red, ſparkling, infeſted with little hard ſwellings in the corners, and apt to water; the upper part of their Noſe contracted, while the inferior is inlarg'd, troubled with fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Sneezing, and infeſted with a Polypus, and Cancious corroſive Ulcers; the Face and Lips are pale, hard, livid and chop'd; their Tongue and Mouth lyable to hard Swellings, Chops, and Corroſion; the Gums rough and ſwoln; the Spittle viſcous; the Breaſts hard, and their Veins ſwoln; the Joints wither'd and beſet with callous indolent Ulcers that are apt to bleed upon the ſlighteſt touch; the Muſcles of their Hands, eſpecially thoſe of the Thumb and firſt Finger, are much conſum'd; the Fingers and Toes benum'd, the Joints diſtorted and knotty, and the Nails black, bow'd and chop'd.</p>
                        <p>The Cure of a Leproſie is the ſame as that of a Scab. If what was recommended upon that Head prove ſucceſsleſs, we muſt have recourſe to the following Medicine; <hi>viz.</hi> Take four quarts of Lye, and a pound of white Arſenic. Boyl them for an hour or two, till the Lye be almoſt conſum'd; then add freſh Lye and boyl again till the Arſenic be diſſolv'd. Then pour off the Liquor by inlination into a clean Veſſel, and add two pound of Ceruſs, diſſolv'd in Vinegar, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated. This will yield a precipitat which ought to be dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify'd, and given for eight days together, from three to ten Grains.</p>
                        <p>The Diſeaſe call'd by the <hi>Arabians, Elephantiaſis,</hi> does not ſpread ſo univerſally over the Body as a Leproſie; as being only a red, livid, or black ſwelling in the Feet, attended by Ulcers in the Veins, that void a ſharp clear Serum. It ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally happens to old People that have drank much Wine; and is frequently Critical. Upon which account we ought to be cautious of applying repellent Medicines. Internally we adminiſter Purges as in a Scab, and the Decoctions of Woods and ſudorific Ingredients for tempering the ſharpneſs of the Serum. Externally we apply the Plaiſter of the Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar Stone, or <hi>Meibomius</hi>'s Plaiſter of the Oyl of Olives, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle-ſoap, Ceruſs, red Lead, and Camphyr. In the mean while we roll up the Legs from the Ancles to the Knees in a Swathe.</p>
                        <p>A Tetter and Ring-worm are near a-kin to a Scab, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only a Cruſt, or hot Puſhes on the Skin, cauſing heat, red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, itching, and roughneſs. They are cur'd by Purging, as in a Scab; and adminiſtring Sudorifics, with Sugar of Lead, or the Antipththiſical Tincture: In deſperat caſes, by Iſſues
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:207638:176"/>or a Salivation. Externally we apply Caſtle-ſoap, mix'd with Spirit of Wine, and Sugar of Lead, and in a word, the ſame things that were recommended for the Scab. In deſperat Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes we uſe Lime-water, or the Ointment of Roſes, mix'd with ſublimat Mercury; or with Mercury precipitated with Spirit of Nitre.</p>
                        <p>The little hot Pimples call'd <hi>Phlyctenes,</hi> that frequently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear about the Wriſts and Fingers, are cur'd internally as a Scab; externally by applying at firſt the Mucilages of Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Linſeed extracted with the water of Frogs-ſpawn, and afterwards Lime-water, and the Ointment of Litharge, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apompholygos, mix'd with Vinegar of Lead. The leſſer Pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, call'd <hi>Sudamina,</hi> are cur'd internally by Purging and Sweating, and externally by waſhing in Milk or Lime-water mix'd with Camphyr, and ſhifting their Linnen often. The Puſhes that have little Worms in 'em, are cur'd internally by joyning the Eſſence of Myrrh, <hi>Elixyr Proprietatis,</hi> Spirit of Harts-horn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the abovemention'd Purgatives and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorifics; and externally by waſhing in the Decoctions of bitter Plants, and applying Plaiſters of their Juices mix'd with Mercury; or picking out the Worms with a Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.</p>
                        <p>The little hard callous ſwellings in the Face and Neck, call'd <hi>Vari,</hi> are for the moſt part red and whitiſh at the top. They ſeem to proceed from the depravation of the Genital Liquor, and moſtly attack ſuch as are ripe for Venery. The internal Cure is the ſame as above. Externally, we apply Cataplaſms of the Oyl of Bays, Ointment of Roſes, ſweet Mercury, and Oyl of Tartar; or a mixture of the Waters of Cows-dung, Elder-flowers, and Frogs-ſpawn, with the Oyl of Tartar <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> Flowers of Sulphur, Borace, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſs, Camphyr, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some commend the Precipitat from Lead, call'd <hi>Lac Virginis.</hi> Some recommend fumigation of the Face with Spirit of Wine ſpit out of the Perſon's Mouth upon a hot Plate of Iron, and follow'd by a freſh fumigation of Myrrh thrown upon the ſame Plate. This, they ſay, will alſo take off Wrinkles, and make old Women look young.</p>
                        <p>Freckles are little yellowiſh Spots in the Face, Neck, Breaſt, and Hands. The Cauſe is the ſtagnation of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum between the Skin and Cuticle, occaſion'd by the heat of the Sun, or otherwiſe. Internally, <hi>Elixyr Proprietatis</hi> and Laxatives are proper. Externally, we waſh the parts with the Water of Cows-dung, or Bean-flowers, mix'd with the whites of Eggs; or anoint it with a Liniment of Frankincenſe,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:207638:176"/>Ceruſs, Myrrh, Brimſtone, Camphyr, and Hen's Fat, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying afterwards Man's Fat to take off the roughneſs and ſcales that ſuch Liniments occaſion. The Oyls of Eggs, Tartar, Guajacum, Wax, and Soap: the Powder of the Roots of Briony and Florentin Orris, ſweet Mercury, the Magiſtery of Lead, <hi>Lac Virginis,</hi> and the corroſive Liquor, call'd <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor Mercurij Saccharatus,</hi> are alſo uſed by turns.</p>
                        <p>The little brown Spots call'd <hi>Ephelides</hi> do generally appear upon big-belly'd Women; or thoſe whoſe terms are ſtop'd, as proceeding from the ſharpneſs of the Serum. For Cure we rub the part with a Citron, or ſower Apple cut up; and waſh it with the Emulſion of Hempſeed, or anoint with a Liniment of Bay-berries and Hony.</p>
                        <p>There are alſo Spots of a ſad yellow Colour, and about a Hands breadth, call'd <hi>Maculae Epaticae,</hi> that ſuddenly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear and diſappear, and render the Skin rough and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſcaly. They proceed from the ſame Cauſe as Frec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles. The internal Cure is accompliſh'd by the Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of bitter and Antiſcorbutical Plants mix'd with Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives: The external, by the Coſmetics above mention'd; or in a difficult caſe by applying a Cataplaſm of Muſtard-ſeed beaten with Vinegar, Salt, and the yolks of Eggs.</p>
                        <p>The red Pimples and Wheals in the Face and Noſe, that moſtly follow hard drinking, proceed from the volatil Acid of Wine, incorporated with the Lymph corroding the Skin. Their internal Cure is compaſs'd by Bleeding, and exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Decoctions of bitter Herbs mix'd with Purgatives; and the adminiſtration of Abſorbent Powders. Externally we apply the Sugar of Lead diſſolv'd, in diſtill'd Vinegar, and mix'd with Camphry and Oyl of Roſes, or with the Juices of Houſe-leek and Plantane, or the Oyl of Tartar <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> mix'd with Camphyr and the Waters of the Flowers of Beans, <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Seal, and Frog's-ſpawn; or an Ointment made of Pepper, Ginger, Brimſtone, and <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngentum Pomatum.</hi> In deſperat Caſes we muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to Mercurial Compoſitions.</p>
                        <p>If the Skin be diſcolour'd by the Heat of the Sun, Puſhes, Pimples, or otherwiſe, its natural Colour may be retriev'd, by applying the Juice of Citrons, or Vinegar impregnated with the Flowers of Beans, <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Seal, Jaſmin and white Lilly Flowers. The Spirit of Wine Camphoris'd; the Eſſence of Benzoin mix'd with fair Water, are alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended. As alſo Powders made of dry'd Venice Soap, white Poppy-ſeeds, Starch, Lupins, Florentin Orris, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtery
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:207638:177"/>of Marcaſite, Moſch, and Zivet; or of Briony and Cuckow-pint Roots, with Sugar of Lead and ſweet Mercury, which are mix'd with the Waters of Figwort-roots, white Lillies, <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Seal, Flowers of Beans, and Roſes, and ſo applyed in the form of a Calaptaſm. Some mightily covet the Oyl of Talk as an admirable Coſmetic, but ſince 'tis not to be had genuin, the Oyl of Tartar <hi>per Deliquium</hi> will ſupply its room, The Decoction of Sublimat Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury in common Water, the water being boyl'd till the Acrimony be quite extinguiſh'd, and than mix'd with Cerues, and after a freſh gentle boyling, clarify'd with the white of an Egg, is a Waſh of infinite uſe in Counterfeiting Colours.</p>
                        <p>The Mange or Scurf that frequently beſets the heads of thoſe who are lyable to the Scurvy, French-Pox, or Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie, ſeems to ariſe from an Acid, ingag'd in a viſcid Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle, that ſtagnats upon the out-Parts, and ſhuts the Pores. It is cur'd internally as the Scab. Externally, let the Head be frequently waſh'd with the Decoction of the Herbs, Southernwood, Betony, Celandin, Soapwort, Mallows, the Roots of Marſh-mallows, ſharp pointed Dock, and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock, Peaſe, Bay-berries and Coloquintida. Let theſe Ingredients be boyl'd in Lye, and reſerve the ſtrain'd Liquor as a waſh for the Head.</p>
                        <p>Before we conclude this Chapter, 'twill not be improper to take notice of the ſheding, or off-falling of the Hairs, which is remedy'd by waſhing with the Decoction of Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, Southernwood, Hony, Myrtle Berries, Linſeed and Oyl of ſweet Almonds, in Wine. The Ingredients being firſt infus'd for twenty four hours; and then boyl'd till the Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture be conſum'd; and the remaining Juice expreſs'd for uſe. If the Hairs are gray, we may indeavour to change their Colour by combing with a Leaden Comb, wet with <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> in which Silver is diſſolv'd, it being qualify'd with common Water. Some commend the Ointment of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, ſharpen'd with Oyl of Bricks, for an Univerſal <hi>Alo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecia,</hi> and exhibit inwardly the Eſſence and Decoction of Woods with Chalybeats.</p>

                     <p>INflammations are occaſion'd by the ſtagnation of the Blood in any part, <hi>viz.</hi> When the Quantity imported is larger than what returns by the Veins.

Pain, which is either accompany'd with a ſenſe of the diſtention of the Fibres and Nervous Parts; or a beating, as ariſing from the rebounding of the Blood, when diſappointed of its Paſſage; or a pricking, as caus'd by the ſharp Salts, when ſtrugling and tending to ſuppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now that ſtagnating Blood is apt to produce thoſe effects, is too plain to need a Proof. The remote Cauſes which promote this Stagnation, are either External or Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. The former are; the occaſional Compreſſion, Contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or Diſtortion of the Veſſels; Pains or the ſhrinking and contraction of the Nervous Fibres, and conſequently of
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:207638:178"/>the Capillary Veſſels, as in Arthritic Pains, and the Tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, or when a Thorn or Waſp ſtings the Part.</p>
                     <p>The internal Cauſes relate either to the general Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood; Or the Infirmity of a particular Part. Thoſe of the firſt ſort are the thickneſs and viſcidity of the Blood, or its being Clotted by a prevailing Acid. Hence the infuſion of an Acid Liquor into a Dog's Vein, redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy of Blood, and the inconſiderat aſſumption of cold Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, or expoſing ones ſelf to the cold after hot Exerciſes, are apt to produce Inflammations. Nay, the Blood of Pleuritic Perſons is viſibly clotted when let forth, and all the Medicines both internal and external, that are recomended for Inflammations are ſuch as diſſolve or attenuat the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd Blood, and drink in the Acid. The Cauſes relating to a Particular part that is frequently more lyable to Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions than its other Companions, are the weakneſs of the Innate Spirit of the Part; the Relaxation, Diſtention, or diſorder of its Fibres, and the hidden remains of an Acid; all owing to preceding Inflammations, eſpecially if they degenerat into Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>If the Acid be very prevalent, the humor hardens, and becomes a Schirrus, not far diſtant from a Cancer: If the Volatil Alkali and the Acid be more equally match'd they ferment together, and combine into a ſalin purulent matter that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges it ſelf by an Ulcer. If the ſtagnation be ſo great, that ſmall quantities of Blood cannot Paſs, and the innate Spirit of the Part cannot Correſpond with the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the Blood corrupts and Cauſes a Gangreen. If the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cali of the Blood be more vigorous and powerful than the Acid, it unlocks the Blood and diſcuſſes the Inflammation. If an Inflammation happen in a temperat Seaſon to young healthy People, and ſettle only in a fleſhy Part, it is leſs dangerous than if it ſiez'd a Nervous Part, or attack'd Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chectic old Perſons. For the moſt part all Inflammations are acute, and accompanied by a Feaver.</p>
                     <p>As for the Cure of Inflammations, Purging is pernicious. Perhaps upon the account of the Feaver, a gentle Laxative may be allow'd. Or if the Belly be Coſtive a Clyſter of Whey and Hony may be injected. Bleeding is very proper eſpicially in the Beginning, as well by way of <hi>Revulſion</hi> in the oppoſit ſide to the part affected, as by way of <hi>Averſion</hi> in the ſame ſide at ſome diſtance, and by way of Derivation juſt by it. But we ought to be cautious of not over-doing and weakening the Patient, or of being miſ-led by the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:207638:178"/>of ſome in hotter Climats, that cannot be look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as precedents in ours.</p>
                     <p>What remains of the internal Cure is admirably accounted for by adminiſtring Volatil Sudorifics that unlock and atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuat the Blood, and Abſorbent Powders that inbibe the Acid. Of the former ſort are the Spirits of <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> volatil Salt of Harts-horn, Venice Treacle, the Spirit of Venice Treacle Camphoris'd, and eſpecially the Spirit, Eſſence, Syrup, or Water of Elder Flowers; To all which we frequently add <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> eſpecially if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs thuart the deſign of Sweating. The Abſorbents are Harts-horn, Ivory, Unicorns-horn, Diaphoretic Antimony, Mineral Bezoar, and eſpecially Crabs Eyes mix'd with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar. Tho' Vinegar be an acid, yet when joyn'd to Crabs Eyes, and abſorbent Powders, it ferments and aſſumes a lixivious Urinous form, which is of admirable efficacy for diſſolving clotted Blood. To theſe we ought always to add <hi>Sperma Ceti,</hi> and the Decoctions, or Waters of Vulnerary Plants as being inrich'd with a plentiful Alcali. The dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify'd Spirit of Nitre, and all the Preparations of Nitre, are alſo of excellent uſe, eſpecially if the Feaver be high.</p>
                     <p>As for external applications, I refer the Reader to the ſixth Book, and ſhall only now take notice of two Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. 1. The miſtake of thoſe who apply repelling Aſtringents, in order to ſtraiten the Veſſels and hinder the Corruption of Blood. Whereas the Doctrine of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation teaches us that the Blood convey'd thither by the Arteries, cannot be beat back, or return any other way than by the Veins: Now to ſtraiten the Veſſels that are already ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the ſwelling, is the ready way to hinder the Bloods acceſs to the Veins and augment the Inflammation. 2. If the tumor cannot be diſcuſs'd, we muſt bring it to a Head by ripening Applications; and when the Ulcer is open ſee it throughly cleans'd before we attempt to conſolidat.</p>
                     <p>The general Cure of Inflammations being thus accounted for, we proceed to Particular Inflammations.</p>

                        <head>ART. 1. <hi>Of a Quinſey, Thruſh, and falling of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vula or Palat of the Mouth.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THE Inflammation of the Muſcles of the Neck, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe of the Windpipe and Gullet is ſtil'd a <hi>Quinſy;</hi> under which we comprehend all Inflammations relating to the Chops. If the <hi>Internal</hi> Muſcles of the Throat or Head of the Gullet are inflam'd 'tis call'd <hi>Synanche;</hi> if the <hi>External, Paraſynanche;</hi> if the <hi>Internal</hi> Muſcles of the Head of the Windpipe, <hi>Cynanche;</hi> if the <hi>External Paracynanche.</hi> If a Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey proceed from the ſimple Stagnation of pure Blood, 'tis accounted <hi>Genuin;</hi> if the Viſcidity of the Lymph be the firſt Author of the Swelling, and ſo accompany or rather cauſe the Stagnation, 'tis a <hi>ſpurious</hi> or <hi>white</hi> Quinſey.</p>
                        <p>The cauſes of a Quinſey are the unſeaſonable ſuppreſſion of a Flux of Blood, malignant Miaſma's in the Air irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Throat and Windpipe, the aſſumption of Corroſive Liquors, which provoke the Muſcles to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions; cold Air, Bones, Pieces of Glaſs, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever happens to diſturb the repoſe of thoſe Parts, or thicken the Blood, or Lymph. The viſcidity or ſharpneſs of the Lymph, has a peculiar tendency to the Inflammation of the <hi>Tonſillae</hi> or Glandules in the Throat; which cauſes 'em to throw out large Quantities of glutinous Lymph upon the Tongue and Jaws.</p>
                        <p>An Imminent Quinſey is uſher'd in by a difficulty of Breathing, ſwallowing, and moving the Neck; and a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Heat in the Throat. The Symptoms that accompany it are a difficulty of Breathing, eſpecially in a <hi>Cynanche;</hi> the tumor, pain, and redneſs of the Neck and Tongue, a viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous Film or Cruſt proceeding from the Tonſillae and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Tongue, a difficulty of ſwallowing, eſpecially in a <hi>Synanche.</hi> A genuine Quinſey is alſo attended by an acute Feaver, and a diſtending Convulſive Pulſe like that in a Peripneumonia. But a ſpurious one by a ſlow Feaver and meeker Symptoms.</p>
                        <p>If this Inflammation be not quickly diſcuſs'd, it either choaks the Patient or becomes an Ulcer, which ſometimes diſtils a purulent matter into the Lungs, and occaſions tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:207638:179"/>Symptoms. If the ſwelling and redneſs diſplay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves viſibly upon the external Muſcles, 'tis a good Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: If the internal ſwelling, and difficulty of breathing increaſe without an apparent Tumor, and be attended by Froth in the Mouth; If the Feaver obſerve the period of a continual <hi>Tertian;</hi> if the Vein under the Tongue, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, do not bleed; theſe, I ſay, are bad Omens. If the Swelling diſappear of a ſudden, without the Signs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction in the Spittle, or diminution of the anxiety of the Breaſt; or if the Head, Pleura, or other parts are ſeiz'd with Pain and inflammation, by vertue of the Tranſlation of the morbifical Matter, we look for Death.</p>
                        <p>The Cure is either internal or external. The former is the ſame with that of Inflammations in general, providing a due regard be had to the peculiar conſtitution of the Parts; as appears by the following Rules.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The volatil Salts and abſorbent Powders above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, join'd to the dulcifi'd Spirit of Nitre and <hi>Laudannm,</hi> are given with good ſucceſs in order to ſweat. Eſpecially Horſe-Dung, and the Dung of Birds, as being plentifully impregnated with a Volatil nitrous Salt; Nitre diſſolv'd in the ordinary Drink, is alſo much approv'd.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Amber, Myrrh, Spirit of Harts-horn, and all Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines recommended for Catarrhs, are very proper in Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeys, by reaſon that the Lymph is always faulty, as well as the Blood.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. In the beginning of the Diſeaſe, we firſt open a Vein in the Leg, then in the Arm, and towards the height, under the Tongue. Before the Invaſion of a Quinſey, if the Patient be not Plethorick, nor the Blood very high, we may order Blood-letting under the Tongue; but in no other caſe before the height. If the Piles or Terms are ſuppreſſed, we muſt always let Blood in the Leg. In deſperate caſes we apply Scarify'd Cupping-Glaſſes to the Neck, Shoulders, and Chin. In fine, the Conſtitution of the Patient, and other incident Circumſtances, muſt be our Directory for regulating the Meaſures of Bleeding.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Epidemical Quinſeys, or ſuch as proceed from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of the Air, muſt be treated as malignant Diſeaſes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Bleeding or Purging. And the Phyſician ought to avoid their Breath as being very catching.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Antimonial Vomits are of ſingular uſe in the beginning of the Diſeaſe, eſpecially if it be epidemical, or if the Patient be moleſted with a bitter ruſty taſte in the Mouth, a tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:207638:180"/>heat in the Gullet, and a loathing of Meat. They are improper at any other time, beſides the very height of the Diſeaſe, when the ſuppuration is in ſome meaſure advanced, and the Swelling cannot be laid open. Then indeed a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit is the laſt Refuge. If the Perſon cannot ſwallow any Liquor, let the Throat be tick'ld with <hi>Mercurius Vitae</hi> with Hony upon a Feather.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Purgatives are improper; as being apt to augment In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations. Perhaps in the beginning, 'twill not be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to cleanſe the firſt Paſſages with a Laxative. But Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ought to be injected every Day, during the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the Diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Bliſtering Plaiſters applied to the Neck, after the firſt Blood-letting, are not improper.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. If the Inflammation of the <hi>Tonſillae,</hi> ariſing from viſcid Lymph, be apt to relapſe frequently, let an Iſſue be cut in the Arm.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. We muſt be very nice in diſtinguiſhing a Quinſey from a <hi>Prunella,</hi> which generally follows Feavers, and requires the application of Medicines improper for a Quinſey. See the Chap. of <hi>Acute Feavers.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The external part of the Cure of a Quinſey is perform'd,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. By Gargariſms, Ointments, Cataplaſms, and Plaiſters of diſcuſſing Ingredients, ſuch as Chamomil and Elder-Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Mint, Penny-Royal, Wild Marjoram, Sage, Hyſſop; the Seeds of Dill, Rapes, Muſtard and Cummin; Saffron, Camphyr, Swallow-wort, the Dung of Animals, the Juice of River-Crabs, the Perſons own Urine, the Spirit of Wine, <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> and Juice of Houſe-leek. The common Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitioners generally add aſtringent Ingredients, whereas they are very pernicious, and augment the Inflammation, by hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Bloods acceſs to the Veins: upon which account we only uſe attenuating volatil Ingredients; as for a Garga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm, the Decoction of Rapes mix'd with <hi>Sal-Armoniac.</hi> Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of Lovage-Roots, ſix drams; Smallage-Roots, three drams; Elder-flowers, a handful and a half; Mallows leaves, a handful. Boil them in Barley-water, and add to the ſtrain'd Decoction, Hony of Mercury, an ounce; Spirit of <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle, ſix drams; ſpirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> a dram. Make a Gargariſm.</p>
                        <p>After the beginning of the Diſeaſe, Gargariſms are impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per as requiring a motion prejudicial and painful to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd Parts. Upon which Account, we order the Patient only to let the Liquor lie in the Mouth for ſome time. As
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:207638:180"/>for Diſcuſſing Cataplaſms, thoſe of bruis'd Wormwood-leaves mix'd with Hoggs-Fat; or of a Swallow's Neſt boil'd in Wine; apply'd to the Swelling, are of excellent uſe. For a Plaiſter, we apply that of Melilot ſoften'd with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd Oyl of Amber. For an Ointment, the Oyl of ſweet Almonds, mix'd with <hi>Sal-Armoniac;</hi> as alſo the following Oyl.</p>
                        <p>Take of Brimſtone pulveris'd, and Salt of Tartar, of each a Dram. Melt 'em, and let 'em ſtand 'till they grow cold. Then pulveriſe the Maſs, and add of the Oyl of ſweet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, three ounces; Oyl of Camphyr half a Dram. Mix, and ſet 'em to digeſt for three Days.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If the Tumor be not quickly diſcuſs'd, we muſt ſet aſide all ſharp provoking Ingredients, and endeavour to bring it to maturity by ſoft, temperat, ripening Medicines. Such are the Decoctions of the Herbs Mallows and Melilot, Marſh-mallows-Roots, and Figs, in Whey or Milk, and ſweeten'd with Hony for a Gargariſm; or the Oyl of ſweet Almonds, and Ointment of Marſhmallows, with which we anoint the outward Parts, and then apply the following Cataplaſm.</p>
                        <p>Take a Swallows-neſt, with the Dung, three roaſted Onyons, and two or three handfuls of Elder-flowers. Boil 'em in Milk. Beat the Pulp thro' a Sive, and add half an Ounce of <hi>Album Graecum;</hi> half a dram of the diſtill'd Oyl of Chamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil; and a ſufficient quantity of the Oyl of White Lillies, in order to make a Cataplaſm.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Tumor being thus ripen'd, we muſt endeavour to open it, by anointing the Jaws with Hony mix'd with Dog's Dung: Or if that be ſucceſsleſs by a Gargariſm of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard-Seed, boil'd in Mead; or of the Oyl of Vitriol mix'd with White-Wine, and ordering the Patient to Cough, and Hauk; and in the laſt extremity, adminiſtring a Vomit, or opening the Larynx.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. When the Ulcer is open'd, it ought to be cleans'd by the Decoction of Barly or Speedwell, mix'd with Hony of Roſes, or Black-ſmith's Water, for a Gargariſm. If it prove very ſordid, we may add the rectifi'd Spirit of Salt, or Spirit of Vitriol; and in deſperate caſes, touch the Ulcer with <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Aegyptiacum,</hi> or <hi>Platerus</hi>'s green Water mix'd with Hony. After 'tis ſufficiently cleans'd, touch it with an Ointment of Myrrh, Florentin, Orris-Roots, Burnt-Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum and Hony of Roſes, and gargle the Mouth with vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerary aſtringent mixtures.</p>
                        <pb n="360" facs="tcp:207638:181"/>
                        <p>As for the Thruſh, or excoriation of the Mouth, it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently attends Feavers, when the Stomac is ſtuff'd with green ruſty Humours, and the Phyſician neglects to cleanſe it, and then it reaches from the Stomac to the Tongue. In other caſes it proceeds from the ſharpneſs of Spittle. If the Cruſt is black, livid, green, flat, and continues long dry, it portends a tedious Diſeaſe. The Cure conſiſts in moiſtening and ſoftening the affected Part. For which end, let the Juice of Rapes, or mucilage of Quinces, with Nitre or freſh Butter and Sugar, be applied to the Tongue. If it degenerat into Ulcers, gargle the Mouth with the Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Speedwell mix'd with Hony; or waſh the Ulcers with the Phlegm of Vitriol and Plantan-Water. In Scorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Caſes, add the ſpirit of Salt, and that of Vitriol; and for Venereal caſes; <hi>Platerus</hi>'s green Water.</p>
                        <p>The falling of the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vula,</hi> is cur'd by applying to it <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi> and Pepper; gargling the Mouth with the Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Self-heal, mix'd with <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi> and crude Allum; or the Decoction of Hemp-ſeed in Vinegar and Water; and applying to the Crown of the Head, a mixture of Yeſt, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine, Maſtic and Amber.</p>

                        <p>THE Cauſes of an Inflmamation of the Stomac, are the ſame as thoſe of other Inflammations. The Symptoms are an Acute Feaver, a Tumor, a Pain and ſenſe of Heat under the ſhort Ribs; an unquenchable Thirſt; unquietneſs and Watchings. The profundity of the Pain, the comparative inviſibility of the Tumour, and the acuteneſs of its Symptoms diſtinguiſh it from the Inflammation of the Liver, or of the Muſcles of the Belly. Sometimes the Inflammation ſuppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates; and then if the purrulent Matter fall inward upon the Guts, there is not ſo much danger, as if it were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd into the external Cavity.</p>

<pb n="361" facs="tcp:207638:181"/>Sudorifics recommended above for Inflammations in general are the Baſis of the Cure. Eſpecially Antimonial Nitre, or the dulcifi'd ſpirit of Nitre, mix'd with the Decoction of Liquorice for ordinary Drinking. The Sugar of Lead mix'd with <hi>Poterius</hi>'s <hi>Antihectic,</hi> Pulp of <hi>Tamarinds,</hi> Mineral Bezo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, and Tartar vitriolated. Externally foment with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Chamomil and red Roſes in Wine; and apply diſcuſſing Cataplaſms of Aromatick Plants boil'd in Wine.

                        <p>As for internal Adminiſtrations: In caſe of Suppuration, exhibit Turpentin diſſolv'd with the Yelk of an Egg in Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious Water, or the rectifi'd Spirit of Tartar, and the Juice of Syrup of Scabious. If the Tumour is open, adminiſter the Decoction of Hyſſop mix'd with Hony, or Chalybeat Milk, or the Decoction of China-Roots and Scabious Leaves with abſorbent Powders, Balſam of <hi>Peru,</hi> Balſam of Sulphur, and the Oyl or Extract of the Flowers of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Wort: If the Stomac be ulcerated by the corroſion of ſharp Liquors, adminiſter firſt a Vomit, and then the Mucilages of Flea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort and Quince-ſeeds, mix'd with Tragacanth, and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of Roſes.</p>
                        <p>The Inflammation of the Guts is caus'd by Dyſenteries, Ruptures, Iliac Pains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Symptoms are a Tumor, Heat, and beating Pain; a Lipyria Feaver, in which the external Parts are cold, while the internal are unſufferably hot; Coſtiveneſs, Retraction of the <hi>Anus,</hi> and ſuppreſſion of Urine. If the ſmall Guts are the ſeat of the Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it appears about the Navel, and is attended by a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of Breathing, and Vomiting.

For Cure, open a Vein in the Arm; inject Clyſters of emollient Ingredients boil'd in Milk; or if theſe be inſufficient, of Lin-ſeed and Rape-ſeed Oyl; and if the Excrements be harden'd, add a dram of <hi>Sal Gem.</hi> If the Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation be ſo great that Clyſters cannot be injected, admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Raiſins, or ſuch like gentle Laxatives for opening the Belly; and gentle Sudorifics for promoting Sweat. Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally apply the Decoction of Mint and Agrimony in Wine, or Lime-Water; or that of Mullein Flowers, and Henbane Leaves in Whey; or the mucilage of Quinces extracted with Houſeleek-Water, and mix'd with Sugar of Lead. If the Inflammation was caus'd by the Contact of any ſharp thing, ſuch as Paper cover'd with Pepper or Vitriol; foment with the Decoctions of emollient Ingredients in Milk, mix'd with the Whites of Eggs. If it cannot be diſcuſs'd, apply <hi>Rulan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>'s Balſam of Sulphur (made of Sugar and the Oyl of Poppies) and inject Clyſters of Chalybeat Milk mix'd with Turpentine and Hony of Roſes. After ulceration, apply Fulminatory Gold mix'd with the Oyl of Sweet-Almonds, and exhibit internally vulnerary Decoctions.</p>

                        <head>ART. 3. <hi>Of Inflammations of the Meſentery, Sweet-bread, and Caul.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THE Inflammations of the Meſentery, proceed from the ſame Cauſes as all other Inflammations, particularly from the critical tranſlation of morbifical Matter into their Glandules, from the unſeaſonable ſuppreſſion of a Dyſentery, or from a rupture haling it out of its natural Seat. The Signs are very obſcure and uncertain, by reaſon of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery's diſtance from the external ſurface, and its open correſpondence with the Nerves of other Parts, which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently obtrude the effect upon us, under the notion of the principal Cauſe. However the following Symptoms will
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:207638:182"/>give us ſome light into the matter, <hi>viz.</hi> A ſenſe of weight in the Belly, eſpecially when the Perſon turns himſelf in his Bed; a gentle Heat towards the Navel, a ſmall Pain, and a ſort of diſtention and Heat under the Stomac; and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity of the Excrements, or their mixture with Chyle, when the Stomac is not diſorder'd. 'Tis diſtinguiſh'd from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations that the Navel is liable to, by the remiſsneſs and dulfleſs of its Pain, and inviſibility of the Tumor, or abſence of apparent hardneſs. If the remote Parts of the Meſentery are only inflam'd, the Feaver that accompanies is but ſlow; but if the Parts adjacent to the Guts be ſeiz'd, the Feaver is acute, the Symptoms much higher, and the Guts ſhare in the Inflammation. When the Tumor ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purats, the Feaver and other Symptoms are exalted, and when it is ready to break, a ſhivering, and ſometimes a ſhaking ſeizes the Perſon, which are ſometimes follow'd by the evacuation of purulent Matter by Stool or Urine.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Inflammations are but ſlow-pac'd, and require a long time before they come to maturity. Their Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms are ſo obſcure, that they do not much trouble the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient at firſt, tho' by degenerating into Schirrus's or Ulcers throwing purulent Matter upon the Entrails, they frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauſe Hectics, Cachexies, Gangrenes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If the purulent Matter be caſt into the Guts, and voided by Stool; It is diſtinguiſh'd from that of Impoſthumes in the Guts by this difference, <hi>viz.</hi> That from the Meſentery comes in a body, mix'd with ſome Blood, and without Pain; whereas the other is ſqueez'd out by drops, with violent Gripings and an Acute Feaver.</p>
                        <p>As for the Cure: Since the Feaver and Symptoms are not Acute, Bleeding is improper; or if any be allow'd, that of the Hemorhoid Veins is only convenient. Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are hurtful; but emollient Clyſters are of excellent uſe. The better part of the Cure depends upon Diſcuſſing Sudorifics, eſpecially the Tincture and Spirit of Tartar, the carminative Spirit, the Eſſence of Steel, the Eſſences of bitter Herbs, ſuch as Wormwood, Centory, Fumitory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Eſſence of Gum Ammoniac, and Chalybeat Diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics. Externally, we apply the Plaiſter of Gum Ammoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac with that of Hemlock (providing it do not exaſperate the Pain. If it do, we conclude that the Inflammation is become an Impoſthume, and the Plaiſter ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd.) When the Impoſthume breaks, and the purulent Matter is voided by Urine, it runs firſt plentifully, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:207638:183"/>intermits; nay, oft-times the Urine it ſelf is very plentiful, and ſeems to precipitat a laudable Sediment to the bottom, which is nothing elſe but the melting of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of the Body, and is juſtly look'd upon as a very bad Sign. Now when we are appehenſive of an Impoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hume, 'twill be requiſite to give Diuretics and Abſtergents, eſpecially Turpentin diſſolv'd with the Yelk of an Egg, and mix'd with Chalybeats; the Balſam of <hi>Peru,</hi> Rhubarb, the Decoctions of Saſſafras, China, Liquorice, and Jujubes; and the Decoction of Agrimony, St. <hi>John</hi>'s Wort, Cichory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in Whey.</p>
                        <p>The Inflammations and ſubſequent Schirrus's and Impoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humes of the Sweet-bread, are of the ſame nature as thoſe of the Meſentery, and equally apt to diſguiſe themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cover of Chronical Diſeaſes, that in effect owe their Birth to them. The like may be ſaid of thoſe of the Caul. Both the one and the other are Cur'd as thoſe of the Meſentery, or other Inflammations.</p>

                        <p>THE Blood being expos'd to the influence of Air in the Lungs, is apt to cauſe Inflammations in the adjacent Parts. When the Lungs or both their ſides are inflam'd, we call it a <hi>Peripneumonia;</hi> if the <hi>Pleura</hi> and only one ſide of the Lungs are affected, 'tis a Pleuriſie. Sometimes the <hi>Mediaſtinum,</hi> Midriff, and the backpart of the Breaſt, or the Membranes of the Shoulders and Neck, ſhare of the Inflammation by turns.</p>
                        <p>The cauſe of ſuch Inflammations is a vicious Acid, which both provokes the Parts to Contractions, and diſpoſes the Blood for Curdling. The remote Cauſes are cold Air, or cold Drink, after great Heats, violent Motion, exceſſive drinking of ſpirituous Liquors, the ſuppreſſion of the Terms, or of a Dyſentery (which do's not radically differ from a Pleuriſie,) a Malignant Conſtitution of the Air, the unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable retreat of a Scab or Cuticular Eruptions, external B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                        </p>
                        <p>Some of theſe Inflammations are <hi>Benign;</hi> others <hi>Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
                           <pb n="365" facs="tcp:207638:183"/>or Epidemical, as proceeding from the Air: ſome are principal Diſeaſes, others only retainers to other diſtempers, as Feavers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſome are ſimple Inflammations only of one Part, others Complicated as when the Middriff is inflam'd at the ſame time with the <hi>Pleura:</hi> ſome are continual, others periodical and apt to return frequently after inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, by reaſon of ſome ſmall remains of the acid Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that were not extirpated in preceding Inflammations: ſome Pleuriſies are call'd Aſcending, when the ſeat of the Pain is above the third Rib, reckoning from the Neck, in which Region the Intercoſtal Veſſels are deriv'd from the Axillary; others deſcending, when the Pain is ſeated betwixt the third and ſeventh Ribs, where the Intercoſtal Veſſels are deriv'd from the inferior Trune of the great Artery. Laſtly, ſome Pleuriſies are Genuin, accompany'd by Feavers and other Symptoms, relating only to the <hi>Pleura</hi> and one ſide of the Lungs; others are ſpurious as being free from acute Feavers.</p>
                        <p>Of the ſpurious Pleuriſies we ſhall mention four Inſtances. 1. When the external Muſcles of the Breaſt and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Intercoſtal Muſcles are only inflam'd. In this caſe the Feaver is ſlow, or there's none at all; the Pulſe is not very hard, the pain is gentle and does not ſhoot, nor is it much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated by touching, and the Patient is eaſie when he lies on the oppoſite ſide. 2. When the Lymph or Serum impregnated with a vicious acid ſtagnats in the Pleura, without inflaming either it or the Lungs. This ſort of Baſtard Pleurifies frequently invades Scorbutical Perſons, or thoſe whoſe nervous Syſteme is infirm. Its Symptoms are, a ſhooting pain in the ſide, without Feaver or Thirſt, a laudable Pulle, and little or no Coughing. 3. When a ſharp ſerous Humour diſtends the <hi>Pleaura</hi> and interco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal Muſcles. This kind of Pleuriſies is generally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to Wind and Vapors. Its Symptoms are a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring periodical pain, that do's not ſhoot, a freedom from a Feaver, Coughing, or bloody Spittings; and a ſenſible eaſe accruing by lying on the oppoſite ſide to the part affected. 4. When the Worms in the Guts occaſion all the Symptoms that attend a genuin Pluriſie, and are only diſcover'd by the diſorders of the Belly and uneaſineſs of the Stomac, compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with Pleuritical Symptoms.</p>
                        <p>The Symptoms common to all Inflammations in the Breaſt, are, 1. A difficult frequent Reſpiration. 2. A continual acute Feaver, Head-ache, Thirſt, and Watching. 3. A frequent, hard, quick, and intermitting Pulſe. 4. The Redneſs and Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:207638:184"/>of the Face and Eyes, and eſpecially of that ſide of the Face correſponding to the inflam'd ſide of the Lungs. 5. A trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome Cough, which at firſt is dry; but afterwards caſts forth a thin parti-colour'd Matter, and in progreſs of time, Blood it ſelf. Towards the declenſion of the Diſeaſe, the Spittings become white, thick, and concocted.</p>
                        <p>The peculiar Symptoms of a <hi>Peripneumonia,</hi> are a notable difficulty of Breathing, and fear of ſuffocation, a heavy pain in time of Coughing towards the lower and hinder part of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> a propenſity to Vomit during the firſt days of the Diſeaſe, and a peculiar exaltation of all feaveriſh Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms. Pleuritical Perſons are moleſted with a pricking ſtitch in the ſide, eſpecially during the time of Inſpiration; and are not ſo apt to Vomit. When the <hi>Midriff</hi> is inflam'd, Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration is more unequal, a dull ſenſe of pain girds the Belly and Back a little above the Loins; Inſpiration is attended by uneaſineſs about the <hi>Sternum</hi> and lower parts of the ſhort Ribs; the <hi>Hypochondria</hi> ſeem to be diſtended; and the Cough is not ſo moiſt as in other Inflammations. The Inflammation of the <hi>Mediaſtinum</hi> reſembles a Pleuriſy in all its Symptoms, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting that of a heavy ſort of pain towards the middle of the fore part of the Breaſt, without pricking or ſtitching. If the Inflammation tend to ſuppuration, they're attended by a ſhivering and increaſe of pain, Feaver, and other Symptoms, which diſappear upon its maturity, and return for a ſhort time while the Skin or Membran of the Tumour is a-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                        <p>Inflammations in the <hi>Thorax</hi> are either diſcuſs'd, or eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated by Spitting, Sweats, Bleeding, Looſeneſs, or a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful flux of Urine. The Inflammation of the Midriff is apt to cauſe fatal Phrenſies. A Pleuriſie is not ſo dangerous as a <hi>Peripneumonia.</hi> If the Patient ſpit white ſmooth Matter about the Fourth Day, the Pleuriſie diſappears on the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth; if theſe ſpittings be put off 'till the Seventh, the Diſeaſe is prolong'd to the Fourteenth. If the Perſon ſpit but little, and that a thin crude Matter, or pure Blood, or a bilious ruſty Humor, with great Pain and difficulty of Breathing, 'tis a deſperate caſe. The Urine affords no certain Prognoſtic in theſe Diſeaſes; ſince all the true ſigns of Concoction belong more naturally to the ſpittings, which are oft-times concocted when the Urine is crude, and <hi>è con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra:</hi> In the beginning of a Pleuriſie, or <hi>Peripneumonia,</hi> bilious Vomitings are well look'd upon; but during the further progreſs of the Diſeaſe they're pernicious. A <hi>Perip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neumonia</hi>
                           <pb n="367" facs="tcp:207638:184"/>ſupervening to a Pleuriſie or Quinſey is very dangerous; but a Pleuriſie following that is a good Omen. Phrenſies and doatings with a ghaſtly Countenance, and a Ceſſation of pain, attending Pleuriſies are for the moſt part fatal. In a word, the good or bad Prognoſtic of Pleuriſies and <hi>Peripneumonia</hi>'s depends upon the meekneſs or fierceneſs of the feaveriſh Symptoms; only the ſmallneſs and intermiſſion of the Pulſe is not ſo formidable as in other Caſes. If theſe Inflammations are not quickly diſcuſs'd they become Impoſthumes, which, if manag'd amiſs, occaſion a Phthiſic.</p>
                        <p>As for the Cure, the Indications are threefold. 1. To diſcuſs the ſtagnating Blood. Or, 2. To promote its evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation by Spitting. Or, 3. To ripen and bring it to a Head. In Purſuance of theſe deſigns, let the following Rules be taken notice of.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In a <hi>Peripneumonia,</hi> Bleeding is of no uſe; in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Pleuriſy 'tis pernicious; in a Benign one it may be ſerviceable, when the Blood abounds, and the Diſeaſe is very Acute; but for the moſt part, 'tis not ſo proper as ſudorifics, nor ſo effectual a preventer of ſuppuration. When 'tis put in Practice 'twill be of uſe to diſtinguiſh an aſcending Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſy from the deſcending; in the former we Bleed for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion in the Leg, and for Averſion in the Arm: In the latter, for Revulſion in the Arm, and for Averſion in the Arm of the oppoſit ſide. However we ought to draw forth but a ſmall Quantity at one time; and repeat the operation after ſhort intervals. 2. Purges and Vomits are improper either in Pleuriſies or Inflammations of the Lungs. The former are apt to cauſe a Looſeneſs and retard the Concoction of the Spittings. The latter draws humors to the Breaſt, and ſo cannot chooſe but be pernicious, unleſs the Original of the evil lye in the Stomac, or the Inflammation be degenerat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Ulcer. Clyſters indeed are very Convenient, when the Belly is Coſtive. 3. Of all Medicines Sudorifics are the beſt, eſpecially for pleuriſies. In the beginning we exhibit vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil Salts and Opiats, notwithſtanding the violent Heat of the Diſeaſe; and towards the height, fix'd Diaphoretics, eſpecially Diaphoretic Antimony. 4. Expectorating Remedies ought not to be adminiſtred till towards the height of the Diſeaſe, when the matter begins to Concoct. If they are given ſooner, they promote Coughing, and conſequently the fruſtraneous and painful concuſſion of the inflam'd Parts, not to ſpeak of their attempting to evacuat crude Matter. However when their ſeaſon comes we ought to beware of mixing 'em with Sugar,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:207638:185"/>Hony, or ſweet Acids. 5. Opiats are only uſeful during the increaſe of the Diſeaſe; they allay the pain, and promote the Concoction of the Matter; but in the height, when the Matter is already prepar'd, they hinder its due evacuation. 6. There's nothing more pernicious than cold Drink. It hurts the Lungs, increaſes the Inflammation, provokes the Cough, hinders Concoction, and thwarts evacuation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let their ordinary Drink be always warm, and ſuch as the Decoction of Barly and Liquorice, mix'd with the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Poppy Flowers.</p>
                        <p>Now, as for the Specifics that diſſolve ſtagnating Blood, thoſe for a Pleuriſie are of the ſame uſe in all Inflammations of the Breaſt. Such are red Poppies, <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> and <hi>Carduus Mariae,</hi> eſpecially their ſeeds; Chervil-water, the Decoction, or Powder of Burdoc-roots, the Juice of Dande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyon, the Soot of Wood-fire given to a dram in Elder Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar; the Pizzle of a Whale, or Hart, given in Powder to a dram, or by way of Decoction; the Powders of Boars-teeth, Pike Bones, Pearch and Carp-ſtones, given to two ſcruples; the volatil Salt of the Jawbone of a Pike; the Blood of a Goat, or of a Hare ſtrangled after Hunting, dry'd and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in Powder, to a dram; the Infuſion or Juice of Horſe or Sheeps Dung, the Powder of Pigeons Dung, <hi>Sperma Ceti</hi> given to a dram with Caſtor; the Spirit of Nitre dulcify'd with the Spirit of Wine impregnated by Cohobation with Antipleuritical Ingredients, given to two drams; the Bezoardic Tincture, given to a dram; the Flowers of Sulphur, or Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, given to a dram; and Antimony calcin'd by the heat of the Sun. The forms of preſcription are as follows.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Seeds of <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> and <hi>Carduus Mariae,</hi> of each two drams; white Poppy Seeds, a dram; with Chervil-water, make an Emulſion.

<pb n="369" facs="tcp:207638:185"/>drams; Jawbone of a Pike, a dram and a half; the inner Rinds of Filberts, a dram; Antimonial Nitre, half a dram; Magiſtery of Coral, a dram and a half; with the thicken'd Juice of Scabious, make a Maſs; of which a ſcruple is a Doſe, to be given in Poppy Flower Water.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Waters of <hi>Carduus Mariae,</hi> Chervil, and red Poppies, of each an ounce; the ſpirit of Venice Treacle Camphoris'd, three drams; Diaphoretic Antimony, and Jaw-bone of a Pike, of each half a dram; volatil Salt of the Jawbones of a Pike, twelve grains; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> three grains; Syrup of red Poppies, an ounce. Mix, and give a Spoonful now and then.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Blood of a Goat, a ſcruple; Mineral Bezoar, half a ſcruple; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> a grain. Make a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for two Doſes.</p>
                        <p>Take of the ſpirit of Venice Treacle Camphoris'd, three drams; Eſſence of Saffron, a dram. Mix. Doſe fifty or ſixty Drops.</p>
                        <p>If theſe diſſolving Medicines cannot diſcuſs the Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation by Sweating, we muſt indeavour to promote the Concoction and Evacuation of the Matter by Spitting. For this end, we firſt uſe thickening Ingredients, and after Concoction thoſe of an attenuating force. Of the former ſort are the Decoctions of Barly, Liquorice, Elecampane, Scabious, Jujubes, Raiſins, Speedwell, red Poppies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> An Apple excavated, ſtuff'd with a dram of Frankincenſe, or Maſtic, and half a dram of the Flowers of Sulphur; and ſo roaſted, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>As for external Application, 'tis proper to allay the pain by fomenting the Part with the Decoction of Emollient and Anodyn Ingredients or applying Frogs-ſpawn with Burdock Roots, or an Ointment of the Juice of Coleworts, and Powder of Cummin ſeed; or of the Fat of a Country Mouſe, or Hen's Dung, with Oyl of Chamomil. Or Thus,</p>
                        <pb n="370" facs="tcp:207638:186"/>
                        <p>Take of the Ointment of Marſh-mallows, an ounce; Oyl of ſweet Almonds, half an ounce; diſtill'd Oyl of Cummin, a ſcruple; Camphyr, nine grains. Mix and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint the part every three hours, applying afterwards the Plaiſter of Melilot, mix'd with the Plaiſter call'd <hi>Filii Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae,</hi> and ſoften'd with the Oyl of Mullein. Every thing muſt be applyed hot, and the part kept very Warm.</p>
                        <p>If the Inflammation can neither be diſcuſs'd, nor diſſolv'd by Expectoration, 'twill be needful to promote its ſuppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, by giving inwardly Preparations from Tobacco, Ground Ivy, Chervil, and Scabious, and applying outwardly Cataplaſms of Holy-hocks boyl'd in Milk, or the Plaiſter <hi>Filii Zachariae.</hi> After 'tis ſufficiently Ripe, we muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for opening it by Vomiting, Sneezing, or adminiſtring the Decoction and ſmoak of Tobacco, which is of Excellent uſe, eſpecially when the Impoſthume is ſeated in the Lungs. Otherwiſe we may diſcover the part where it lyes, by the Heat, Pain, Swelling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and open a direct Paſſage into it betwixt two of the Ribs. When the Impoſthume opens of it ſelf, its Matter do's not always run into the Cavity of the Breaſt, as many imagine, but is oft-times gather'd within the dilated Membran that ſurrounds the Pleura, in which Caſe a <hi>Paracenteſis,</hi> or opening in the uſual place for an <hi>Empyema,</hi> is of no uſe. After opening the Impoſthume the next thing is to cleanſe it by exhibiting the Decoctions of Chervil, or rather the Syrup or Juice of ground Ivy, and Syrup of Tobacco, with the Balſam of Sulphur, Balſam of <hi>Peru,</hi> and the Spirit and Oyl of Turpentin.</p>

The firſt of which is treated as other external In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations in general. The ſecond proceeding from a ſharp Acid Lymph, ſtagnating in the <hi>Pleura,</hi> requires volatil Salts, ſuch as the ſpirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> &amp;c. mix'd with Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleuritical Specifics, and during the increaſe of the Diſeaſe with Opiats. If the Urine be muddy and Precipitat a <hi>Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> 'tis proper to add Diuretics, in order to diſcharge the Matter by Urine, according to Nature's Direction. Externally Oily fat things wo' not be ſo convenient, as dry hot Bags, or Frictions with a hot Cloth, and a Plaiſter of the volatil Salt of Urine and Turpentin. The third ſort is alſo cur'd by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil Salts and Diaphoretics, mix'd with Opiats; to which in ſcorbutical Caſes we add Adtiſcorbutics.

                        <head>ART. 5. <hi>Of Inflammations and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers of the Liver and Spleen.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>INflammations of the Liver are frequenty caus'd by the external application of hot Plaiſters, and Cupping-glaſſes, not to ſpeak of the common Cauſes of other Inflammations. As for Diagnoſtics, 'tis needful to obſerve that when the convex Part of the Liver is inflam'd, they're attended moſtly by the Symptoms of a Genuin Pleuriſie and when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave is chiefly troubled, the Symptoms of the Stomac and Guts, ſuch as Vomiting, Looſeneſs, Inappetency, Loathing, Sighing, Hickcup, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are moſt notorious. The Pain of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd Liver is always obſcure, heavy, and diſtending; for the ſhooting Pains that ſometimes infeſt the right Hypocon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drium, are juſtly charg'd to the Colon: The Feaver heat, and ſuch like Symptoms, are not ſo Acute as in other Caſes, by reaſon that the Liver enjoys only a ſmall quantity of arterious Blood. Oft-times the Midriff ſhares the Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation with the Liver, by means of the Ligament which annexes the one to the other; and then the Perſon is ſenſible of Pain in the Throat, as if it were pull'd downward when he breaths, he is troubled with a dry ineffectual Cough, difficulty of Breathing, and a quick unequal Pulſe, and chooſes rather to lye on his Back than on either ſide.</p>
                        <p>Thus the Inflammation of the Liver is diſtinguiſh'd from a Pleuriſie in the Right-ſide, by the remiſſneſs of its Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, the abſence of a ſtitch or ſhooting Pain, the dryneſs and meekneſs of the Cough, the largeneſs and openneſs of the Pulſe, the ſenſe as it were of a weight hanging upon the Right-ſide of the Thorax, and the eaſineſs of Reſpiration in reſpect of Inſpiration. 'Tis diſtinguiſh'd from the Colic by the Feaver, Cough, and difficulty of Breathing, that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic is a ſtranger to; as alſo from the Inflammation of the Muſcles of the Belly, by the anxiety of the Breaſt, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative inviſibility of the Tumor, intenſeneſs of its Symptoms, and the abſence of a beating Pain. Sometimes
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:207638:187"/>a reddiſh black line appears in the right Hypocondrium, and by its pain diſcovers the Inflammation of the Liver. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Liver reaches to the very middle of the Belly, and diſcovers its Tumor in the Centre.</p>
                        <p>As touching the Prognoſtic, the Inflammation of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave part is more dangerous, than that of the Convex, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if attended by a Hiccough; if the Feaver be very acute, the Belly ſwoln, and the external Parts cold, while the Internal burn within, or if black greeniſh Matter be Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, 'tis a deſperat Caſe. If the Inflammation and Feaver continue above twenty Days, it degenerats into an Ulcer or Schirrus; and the purulent Matter is voided moſtly by Stool or Urine, or at leaſt but very rarely by Vomiting or Spitting. If a Copious evacuation of Urine follow the uſe of Nitre, 'tis a good Omen.</p>
                        <p>The internal Cure is compaſs'd by Antipleuritical Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, ſuch as the Sugar of Lead, or rather the Cryſtals of Lead, with Spirit of Nitre, Antimonial Nitre, Diaphoretic Antimony, volatil Salt of Vipers, and the common Sudorifics mix'd with <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> and bitter Apperients. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally we apply the ſpirit of Wine Camphoris'd with Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Water, or Nitre with Vinegar of Roſes and the Juice of Houſeleek; or what follows.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Ointment of Marſh-mallows, half an ounce; Oyl of Wormwood, two drams; diſtill'd Oyl of Dill, a ſcruple; Camphyr, nine grains. Make a Liniment, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint the Part. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Waters of Henbane, Plantan, and Water Lillies, of each an ounce; purify'd Nitre, half a dram; Camphyr diſſolv'd in ſpirit of Wine, fifteen grains. make an Epithema, to be applied Warm.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes the Inflammation of the Liver proceeds from exceſſive Venery, and 'tis cur'd thus. Take a living black Cock and cut out his Liver, which bruiſe in four ounces of Vinegar of Roſes, till it be quite diſſolv'd. Then ſtrain the Vinegar, and exhibit it warm for a Draught; in the mean while, let the Patient take every Morning a Draught of the Decoction of Liquorice, Cichory, Rhubarb, Leſſer Centory, Liverwort, and the inner Rinds of Elder; adding to Every Draught a ſcruple of <hi>Sperma Ceti.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If notwithſtanding theſe Precautions the Inflammation come to a head, which will appear by the Feaver, Heat, and Shiverings that attend it, and their abatement when 'tis over; in that Caſe we exhibit inwardly the Decoction of China
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:207638:187"/>Roots, Liquorice and Raiſins. And apply Emollient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſms, with Saffron, and Wormwood Tops. If the ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be ſeated in the Convex part, it may be open'd with a Knife, or a Potential Cauſtic. If it lye in the Concave ſide, we muſt endeavour by all means to break it, and when 'tis broken follow the conduct of Nature, in promoting the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuation of the purulent Matter. As, if it be emptied into the Guts, we exhibit Mead for tempering its ſharpneſs, and inject Clyſters; if it be diſchar'd by Urine, we adminiſter Oxymel, with the Decoctions of Smallage, Parſſey, Juniper-berries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in Mead. If it recoyl into the Stomac, and cauſe Vomiting, we forward it with fat Broth, Oyl of ſweet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If it corrode the Membran, and caſt it ſelf into the Cavity of the Abdomen, 'tis a very dangerous caſe, in which ſome chooſe to open the Abdomen, and give vent to it; in the mean while we exhibit inwardly the Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of China, Sarſaparilla, and the Vulnerary Ingredients, to which we add Turpentin diſſolv'd in the yelk of an Egg, or the Balſam of Sulphur prepar'd with Oyl of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentin.</p>
                        <p>The Inflammations of the Spleen ought to be nicely diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd from thoſe of the adjacent right Kidney, as being attended by a beating Pain, towards the fore-ſide of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen, difficulty of Breathing, a moderat continual Feaver; whereas the Inflammations of the Kidney diſplay themſelves moſtly in the Back, and their Feaver is very high, without any ſenſible Pulſation. In Inflammations of the Spleen, Bleeding at the left Noſtril, Fluxes of the Piles, a Looſeneſs and Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful evacuations of Urine, attended by the ſigns of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, are good Omens. Their Cure is the ſame as that of other Inflammations; internally all preparations of Lead, mix'd with Diaphoretics; and externally, the Plaiſter of Hemlock with the Oyl of Camphyr, and the Syrup of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, with Sugar of Lead, are of excellent uſe.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>THE Inflammations of the Kidneys may proceed from Riding, Falls, Jumping, Stones in the Kidneys, exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Venery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Their Symptoms are; a heat of Urine and Strangury; a ſenſe of heat and pain in the Loyns, which
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:207638:188"/>by the Correſpondence of the Membrans, frequently rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches upwards to the ſhort Ribs, and along the back, ſo that the Perſon cannot bow his Body, and beſides is frequently moleſted with Vomiting; and likewiſe downwards towards the Ureter, Bladder, Huckle-bone and Thigh, cauſing a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Legs. Sometimes when one Kidney is inflam'd, the other is either by Sympathy ſeiz'd with Spaſmodical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions, or ſo oppreſs'd with the Quantity of Blood, that 'tis unfit for ſecretion, and cauſes a Dyſuria: To theſe Symptoms we add Coſtiveneſs and Chilneſs of external Parts. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a ſimple Stone in the Kidneys, apes the Symptoms of an Inflammation, but the continual Duration and Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the Pain, the acute continual Feaver, the heat and difficulty in making Water, that attend the latter, and are ſtrangers to the former, will point out the Diſtinction. If an Inflammation of the Reins happen to weak puny Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or be attended by doating, or if it become an Ulcer, 'tis very dangerous. The Flux of the Emrods is a good ſign; but white purulent Urine, with the abatement of the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and extenuation of the Legs and Thighs, is a certain forerunner of Death.</p>
                        <p>As for the Cure, the external Remedies are the ſame as thoſe preſcrib'd for a Quinſey, and the internal are the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifics for a Pleuriſie, eſpecially Nitre, Sugar of Lead, and the Juice of River Crabs, given with the Decoction of Prunes, or the Emulſions of cold Seeds. Purgations are noxious, unleſs crudities diſturb the Stomac, in which Caſe the gentleſt Laxatives are only allowable. Emollient Clyſters, or thoſe of Milk, Turpentin, and the yelk of Eggs, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Diuretics in the Beginning increaſe the Inflammation, but when the matter is concocted, the more temperat ſort of 'em is uſeful, eſpecially Winter Cherries, Liquorice, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Waters of Winter Cherries, Broom and St. <hi>John</hi>'s wort, of each an ounce; diſtill'd Vinegar, ſix drams; dulcify'd ſpirit of Nitre, half a dram; Tartar Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated, fifteen grains; Syrup of Ground Ivy, half an ounce. Mix. Doſe a ſpoonful or two.</p>
                        <p>Externally, we firſt Blood 'em in the Arm, then in the Ancle; and apply the juice of Houſe-leek, with the juice of River Crabs and Camphyr, to which we ſometimes add the Oyl of Henbane, or expreſs'd Oyl of Poppies. <hi>Langius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends an Ointment of Crude Allum, mix'd with the whites of Eggs. If by theſe means the Inflammation cannot
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:207638:188"/>be diſcuſs'd, we muſt promote its ſuppuration inwardly by the Decoction of Liquorice, Barly, Pellitory of the Wall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And outwardly by Cataplaſms of Emollient Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents boyl'd in Milk.</p>
                        <p>Ulcers of the Reins are ſometimes the effect of Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſometimes of the Corroſion of a Stone. The former are leſs dangerous, and are attended by a whitiſh Urine, which by ſtanding precipitats a white Purulent Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment, whereas in the latter Caſe the Sediment is Aſhy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd, and the pain in the Loyns more biting and gnawing. In either caſe fetid Stools are a good ſign. For Cure we firſt exhibit a Vomit, in order to cleanſe the Ulcer, then Pills of ſweet Mercury with Turpentin or Balſam <hi>Capivi;</hi> the Decoction of Woods, Parſley, Chervil, Chicles and Agrimony, and above all the Troches of Winter Cherries, and the Powder of dry'd river Crabs. Or the following Decoction.</p>
                        <p>Take of Agrimony and Flowers of St. <hi>John</hi>'s wort, of each a handful; Maſtic-wood, an ounce and a half; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey Roots, half an ounce; Seeds of St. <hi>John</hi>'s wort, three drams. Boyl them in Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Spaw Waters and abſorbent Powders are alſo not improper. If the Ulcer be ſeated in the out-ſide of the Reins, and ſeize the Muſcles of the Back, it ought to be laid open.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>THE Bladder having only a few ſmall Blood Veſſels, is ſeldom or never inflam'd by internal Cauſes; but moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by external injuries, or the aſſumption of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Flies, or the cutting of the Stone. The Symptoms are a Diſtenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Heat, Hardneſs, Tumor, and unſufferable Pain in the Pubes; a ſuppreſſion of Urine, Teneſmus, Coſtiveneſs, acute Feaver, and ſometimes Doating. It is a dangerous Diſeaſe, as being very apt to degenerat into a Gangreen, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be ſeated in the muſcular Neck of the Bladder, in which Caſe it oft-times ſuppurats and becomes a troubleſome Ulcer. The ſuppuration is diſcover'd by the Remiſſion of the Symptoms; and when the Ulcer breaks by the evacuation of Purulent Matter with the Urine, without it break into the
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:207638:189"/>Cavity of the Abdomen, and then it frequently gains a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage by Impoſthumes in the Groyn.</p>
                        <p>For Cure, we treat theſe Inflammations after the ſame manner, as thoſe of the Kidneys, in order to diſcuſs 'em. As for Injections of Cooling Liquors they're altogether uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, partly becauſe they do not reach the Part, and partly becauſe, ſuppoſing their entrance into the Bladder, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conveniently be voided again. The Ulcers of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ought to be carefully diſtinguiſh'd from thoſe of the Urethra, which frequently void purulent matter, without the Urine, and cauſe a violent pain in making Water, which is not found in Ulcers of the Bladder, unleſs they be ſeated juſt in its Neck. Ulcers are cur'd by dulcifying the humors of the Body, and conſequently the Urine; clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and, conſolidating the Ulcer, and mitigating the Pain. The Ingredients that are proper for theſe Purpoſes are frequently mention'd above. The forms of Recipe's are as follows.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Herbs Agrimony, Plantan and Horſe-tail, of each half an handful; Liquorice Roots, two drams; Boyl them in Plantan and Betony Water, till the third Part be Conſum'd. To half a pound of the ſtrain'd Liquor, add Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Roſes, an ounce and a half. Mix, and exhibit a Draught twice a day, for mitigating the ſharp humors; for which end the Decoction of Ground-pine in Milk is alſo very uſeful.</p>
                        <p>Take of Turpentin, ſix drams; Hony, an ounce; with the yelk of one Egg, diſſolve 'em in four ounces of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wine. Mix. Doſe, ſix drams; for the abovemention'd uſe, and for cleanſing the Ulcer.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Shavings of <hi>Lignum Sanctum,</hi> three ounces; Roots of Sarſaparilla, Liquorice, and Eryngo, of each an ounce; of the Herbs Agrimony, Speedwell, and Ground Ivy, of each half a handful; Flowers of Roſes and Violets, of each three little handfuls; Raiſins, an ounce and a half. Boyl them in Water, and exhibit a Draught of the ſtrain'd Decoction frequently, for conſolidating the Ulcer.</p>
                        <p>Take of Liquorice Roots, two ounces; red Vetches, a little handful; the Rinds of Beans, an ounce; Plantan Leaves, a handful; Boyl them in Water, with a little lye, adding two ounces of Turpentin diſſolv'd in Hony to a pound of the ſtrain'd Decoction; and in deſperat Caſes the Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Aegyptiacum.</hi> Mix, and inject it with a Syringe for cleanſing the Ulcer.</p>

Their Symptoms are a viſible beating in the Carotid Arteries, and an unſufferable tearing Pain in the Head, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging the ſick Perſon to throw, toſs, and as it were, beat his Head, and furiouſly pull at the Hair. They are atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by doating, and are apt to degenerat into fatal Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grenes, at which time Convulſions, proſtration of Strength, and a ſort of a Lethargy inſue. Their Urine is pale, crude, and white; and if their Stools be alſo white, if the Teeth gnaſh, the Noſe drop, and the Perſon tremble, ſhake, and pick at the Bed-Cloaths, 'tis a deſperate caſe. Sometimes Phrenetic Perſons are only moleſted with frightening Dreams, and a timorous inward doating, without any noiſe, which is a worſe Symptom than open fury, loud out-cries, and violent toſſings of the Limbs. A Phrenſie is diſtinguiſh'd from a ſimple Delirium, by the unrelenting vehemence of the Feaver and Head-ache, and a difficulty of breathing.

                        </head>
                        <p>A Genuin Inflammation of the Eyes is either Sanguine or Serous. The former is call'd <hi>Ophthalmia;</hi> the latter <hi>Epiphora,</hi> or <hi>Lippitudo.</hi> An <hi>Ophthalmia</hi> is an Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Tunicles of the Eye, eſpecially the Conjunctive, which by reaſon of their Derivation from, and being of a piece with the Membranes of the Brains, are apt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate their diſorder to the Brain; as on the contrary, the diſorders of the Brain are frequently diſplay'd in the Eyes. The External Cauſe is whatever provokes the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres to Contraction, and conſequently obliges the Blood to ſtagnate in the ſmall Arteries, which are very plentiful in the Coats of the Eyes; as the ſharp <hi>effluviums</hi> of the Air, Duſt, ſteams of Metals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The internal cauſe is the ſuppreſſion of any evacuation of Blood, or the retention of a ſharp Acid in the Body, as after the Small Pox, or when the running of the Ears, cuſtomary to Children, ceaſes. Sometimes an Inflammation proceeding from the <hi>Effluvium</hi>'s of the Air, is epidemical; and ſometimes catching. The Symptoms of an <hi>Ophthalmia</hi> are, the Heat, Tumor, Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Pain and watrineſs of the Eyes. In its higheſt pitch, the Eye-lids are likewiſe inflam'd, and unable to ſhut, and the White of the Eye is ſwell'd up above the adjacent Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, with a ſort of Chink betwixt 'em. If the ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating Blood proceed from the outer Veſſels, we obſerve a Pain, Tumor, and beating in the Temples; if from the internal Membranes and Veſſels, the Pain is more vehement, and lies deep, the Palat and Noſtrils itch, and the Perſon is apt to ſneeſe often.</p>
                        <p>As for the Epiphora and blear'dneſs of the Eyes, the former is a deſtillation of a Cold or Hot Rheum from the Glandules in the corners of the Eyes; the latter from the Glandules of the Eye-lids, in conjunction with thoſe of the Eyes. Their Cauſes are,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Laxity of the Glandules, as in Old Perſons, and in malignant Diſtempers, when the Animal Spirits are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extinguiſh'd; or when the Caruncle that ſhuts them
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:207638:190"/>is Corroded or Cut. In this caſe, the Eyes are apt to be red, for that the Blood Veſſels ſwell when the Glandules are ſo often emptied.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The irritation of the Eye and its Glandules, by ſharp <hi>effluviums</hi> from the Air, Pepper, Onions, Garlic, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Cauſe is at the ſame time apt to cauſe an <hi>Ophthalmia.</hi>

                        <p n="3">3. The ſharpneſs and acidity of the Lymph, which tickles, provokes, and corrodes the Glandules. The Corroſion is frequently follow'd by a roughneſs, and that by a thickneſs and intranſparency; and conſequently, a total blindneſs. The Remote Cauſes are whatever is apt to occaſion Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrhs.</p>
                        <p>All theſe Inflammations, whether Sanguin or Serous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are attended by a warrineſs or running of a Humour that is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſharp, ſaltiſh, corroſive, and apt to gaul the Cheeks; or inſipid, ſlimy, thick, and apt to make the Eye-lids ſtick to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The former is call'd a hot Catarrh, the latter a cold one. The various Condition of this Catarrh, preſents us with four obſervable Periods in an Inflammation. The <hi>Firſt,</hi> is call'd the Beginning, <hi>viz.</hi> When the Humor is thin and plentiful. The <hi>Second,</hi> the Increaſe, when the Pain grows, and the Humor thickens. The <hi>Third,</hi> the Height, when the Humor is concocted, and makes the Eye-lids ſtick toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The <hi>Fourth,</hi> The Declenſion, when all the Symptoms relent. But withal, we ought to remember that this Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor is ſometimes the Effect, and not the Cauſe of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, as in the caſe of external irritation, for which A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringents are proper, tho' noxious in other Caſes.</p>
                        <p>A ſpurious Inflammation is diſtinguiſh'd from the <hi>Genuin,</hi> by its comparative dryneſs, and admits of three Degrees.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. When the Eyes itch, and void a ſmall quantity of a ſaltiſh Rheum.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. When the Eyes are red, ſwollen, heavy, and moleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a gentle Pain and Itching, without any flux of Matter.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. When the Eye-lids are hard and rough, without itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or running.</p>
                        <p>The Inflammations of the Eyes proceeding from the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of the Membranes of the Brain, are very dangerous. If the Pain continue long, 'tis an ill ſign. If the Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be very tedious, or apt to relapſe, it threatens a thickneſs of the Membranes, or Webs, Scars, and loſs of Eye-ſight: If it tend to ſuppuration, it threatens a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene, which, if the Eye be not quickly extirpated, is apt
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:207638:191"/>to invade the Brain, the conſequence of which is certain Death. A dry or ſpurious Inflammation is tedious, but not ſo dangerous as a wet one. Sometimes critical Looſeneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes give the ſolution of the Diſtemper. As for <hi>Epiphora</hi>'s, if they prove inveterat in adult Perſons, they degenerat to a <hi>Fiſtula Lacrymalis,</hi> which is oft-times incurable.</p>
                        <p>As for the Cure: When the Inflammation proceeds from external Cauſes, a few external Medicines may give relief. But when the Cauſe is internal, we proceed thus. Firſt of all we open a Vein in the Leg, then in the Arm, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tewards, but not ſooner, in the Forehead, if it can be done without ſtraitening the Neck. In deſperat caſes, we open the Jugular Veins, and ſometimes the Temporal Artery. Bliſtering Plaiſters appli'd to the nape of the Neck, are of excellent uſe, as occaſioning a plentiful Flux of Blood into the outer branch of the Artery of the Neck, which muſt needs drain the inner-branch that viſits the Eyes. They are beſt prepar'd of <hi>Emplaſtrum Citrinum,</hi> mix'd with the Powder of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Flies whout Acids and the Bliſters ought to be kept long open, with the Plaiſter of Ceruſs, mix'd with a ſmall quantity of the Powder of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Flies. In Hydropical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or ſuch whoſe Skin does not eaſily heal, Bliſtering Plaiſters may be omitted. In difficult Caſes, we order Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues in the Arm or Leg of the ſame ſide with the inflam'd Eye, and a Setum in the Neck: Inſtead of a Setum, ſome chuſe to make a ſort of Iſſue in the Ear, thus; Take the Root of Hellebor, or Mezereon, dry it, and ſlice it into little round pieces, which macerat in the ſolution of Nitre in Water, or the Lye of the Aſhes of Vine-twigs. Then bore a Hole in the Ear, and promote its ſuppuration for three Days with a thread cover'd with Butter, and then put in one of theſe pieces thus prepar'd, renewing 'em every day. Internally, we exhibit Jalap for a Purge, and the Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of China-Roots, Saſſafras, Sarſaparilla and Juniper-Wood, to which we add the Cephalic Dryers, ſuch as Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, Eye-bright, Valerian, Betony, Roſemary, and their Eſſences. If the Inflammation proceed from Mineral Fumes, we give Mineral Preparations inwardly. In external Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, we ought to avoid <hi>Opium,</hi> and Milk, tho' com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="381" facs="tcp:207638:191"/>the Diſtemper, while the heat, pain, redneſs, and ſharpneſs of the Rheum prevail, abſorbent Powders are proper, ſuch as Tutty, Ceruſs, Chalk, Flowers of Tin, Crabs-Eyes, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laminar-ſtone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In general, the Water of Frogs-ſpawn, the Water diſtill'd from bruis'd River-Crabs, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to putrifie, and diſtill'd again with the Juice of Celan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din; the Oyl or Liquor <hi>per deliquium</hi> of Blew-bottle or Succory flowers, they being gather'd in the Morning when wet with the Dew, and put into a thick Glaſs, encompaſs'd with a thick Cruſt of Dough, and ſo baked in an Oven 'till they melt into Liquor; the Phlegm of the Spirit of Vitriol, the Oyl of Sugar <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> or Sugar it ſelf ground in a new Tin Platter 'till it become livid; the Sugar of Lead, Camphyr; the mucilages of Flea-wort and Quince-ſeeds, extracted with Celandin Water; the Phlegm of Allum, Whites of Eggs, the ſtrain'd Decoction of the Litharge of Gold in Vinegar, the Infuſion of <hi>Crocus Metallorum</hi> or the Glaſs of Antimony; and in the height of the Diſtemper Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyriums prepar'd with white Vitriol, are all approv'd Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines. If the Inflammation proceed from external Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the above mention'd Mucilages, or a piece of raw Beef or Veal applied to the Eye, will finiſh the Cure. If the Rheum be very ſharp and corroſive, we inſiſt much upon fix'd abſorbent Powders; if it be thick and ſlimy, diluting Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines and gentle Aſtringents are convenient: Theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients are preſcrib'd in various Forms. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of the mucilages of the Seeds of Quinces, Clary, and Fenugrec, extracted with Celandin Water, of each half an ounce; Sugar of Lead, twelve grains. With Fennel or Eye-bright-water, make a Collyrium.</p>
                        <p>Take of Plantan and Eye-bright-water, of each an ounce; prepar'd Tutty, half a Scruple; Camphyr, five grains; Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron, two grains. Make a Collyrium, to be us'd after the Small-Pox.</p>
                        <p>Take of Tormentil or Plantan-Water, of each an ounce; mix 'em with the White of an Egg, and ten grains of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum. And apply it warm to the Eyes.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Glaſs of Antimony in Powder, from ten to fifteen grains; infuſe 'em in three ounces of the Water of Frogs Spawn. Let 'em ſtand all Night in a hot place. Strain the Liquor in the Morning, and add to it ten grains of the Sugar of Lead in fine Powder, and ſix grains of Camphyr.</p>
                        <pb n="382" facs="tcp:207638:192"/>
                        <p>Take an Egg, boil it hard, and take out the Yelk, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into its place ſix grains of the Sugar of Lead, eight grains of white Vitriol, two grains of Camphyr, and half an ounce of the Hony of Roſes. When they're melted, ſqueeze out the Liquor and drop it into the Eye, eſpecially when the Rheum is ſlimy, and apt to make the Eye-lids ſtick togethet.</p>
                        <p>Take of Roſe-water, and Plantan-water, of each two ounces; Night-ſhade-water, an ounce; white Vitriol, a ſcruple; diſſolve and ſtrain, then add a ſcruple of prepar'd Tutty. Make a Collyrium; in which dip a Clout, and apply it warm to the Eyes, about the height of the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Ointment Diapompholigos, and that of Tut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of each two drams; prepar'd Pearl, Coral, Crabbs-Eyes, Tutty, and Sugar of Lead, of each a Scruple; Camphyr, twelve grains; Leaves of Gold and Silver, of each four. Make an Ointment. With which, anoint the lower part of the Eye-lids, and put about the bigneſs of a Lentil into the corner of the Eye.</p>
                        <p>Take of ſweet Apples roaſted, three in number; boil them in Eye-bright-water 'till they be ſoft; beat their Pulp thro' a ſieve, and add of prepar'd Tutty, two Drams; Camphyr, ten grains; Saffron, four grains. Make a Cataplaſm for allaying the Pain and Heat.</p>
                        <p>Take of freſh Butter, half an ounce; Sugar of Lead, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd Tutty, and Calaminar ſtone, of each a ſcruple; Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyr, a grain. Make a Liniment for anointing the Eye-lids in a dry Inflammation.</p>
                        <p>A ſerous Inflammation is cur'd by extracting the external Objects that diſturb the Eye, or correcting the Acrimony of the Lymph, or ſtrengthening the Glandules. For the firſt purpoſe, we apply to the Eye, a Crabs Eye making its hollow part to touch the apple of the Eye, or a Seed of Clary; or we make uſe of Inſtruments, ſuch as <hi>Hildanus</hi> recommends. The Second Indication is accounted for in the Chapter of <hi>Catarrhs.</hi> The Third is compaſs'd by moderat Aſtringents, outwardly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; ſuch as the Decoction of the Rinds of Pomgranats, with Chamomil-Flowers, eſpecially after the Small Pox; the infuſion of Tormentil Roots, and Allum, in Plantan and Roſe-water; or of Tutty in Fennel-water; the Powder of Citron Myrobalans infus'd three or four times in Roſe-water, and dry'd a-freſh every time; the Liquor that flows from a Willow cut in the Spring; the Decoction of dry'd Rue
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:207638:192"/>in Vinegar and Hony; or that of Cows-bones and the Chaff of Wheat, recommended by ſome as a valuable <hi>Arcanum;</hi> a mixture of the White of an Egg, Roſe-water, and Sugar beaten in a Tin Plate; the Decoction of Quince-Leaves; the Infuſion of the Powder of Calaminar-ſtone (upon which the Spirit of Wine has been Kindled) in White Wine, or Roſe-water; or that of the Powders of Tutty, Sarrocol, Roman Vitriol and Sumac, in Eye-bright and Fennel-waters. The uſe of ſneezing Powders is much dreaded by ſome, but the Veſſels leading from either Eye to the Noſtrils, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd by <hi>Steno,</hi> and the Experiment of <hi>Collyrium</hi>'s reaching the Mouth, ſeems to juſtifie it. However, ſince ſo many tragical Evils have been obſerv'd to follow 'em, we ought to be very cautious, and never preſcribe any but what are very gentle, and that in the declenſion of the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or when the Inflammation ceaſes.</p>

                        <p>THE internal Membran of the Ears is ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd, either by Internal or External Cauſes.

                     <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of the Effuſion of Blood into the Cavities of the Body, and particularly of an</hi> Empyema.</head>
                     <p>WHEN the Blood ſtagnates in its own Veſſels, and is converted into Purulent Matter, it cauſes a <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mica</hi> or Impoſthume in ſeveral Parts of the Body, which we diſpatch'd in the laſt Chapter. But when this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent Matter is collected in a diſtinct Cavity 'tis call'd an <hi>Empyema,</hi> which is the ſubject of this Chapter: 'Tis true, the Ancient <hi>Grecians</hi> meant by <hi>Empyema,</hi> any Collection of purulent Matter in any part. But ſince the Modern Latin Writers have Chriſten'd it otherwiſe, we chooſe to follow their Examples. The immediat Cauſe of an <hi>Empyema,</hi> is
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:207638:193"/>either the direct effuſion of Blood into the Cavity it ſelf, which ſtagnats, curdles, and by fermenting becomes <hi>Pus;</hi> as when the Breaſt is wounded; or the eruption of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent Matter from its own Impoſthume into a forreign Cavity, as when a Pleuritical Impoſthume breaks, it oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times throws its Matter into the Cavity of the Breaſt, and gives riſe to what we call, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, an <hi>Empyema:</hi> Tho' ſometimes the Pleuritical Matter is contain'd within a Purſe of the dilated <hi>Pleura,</hi> while 'tis erroneouſly referr'd to the Cavity of the Breaſt. The remote Cauſes are Bruiſes, Falls, Wounds, or whatever breaks the Veſſels, and occaſions the extravaſation of Blood.</p>
                     <p>The Symptoms diſcovering the extravaſation of clotted Blood relate either to the Belly, Breaſt, or Head. Thoſe for the Belly, are a Tumor, Paleneſs, Lead colour, and hardneſs of the Abdomen, occaſion'd by the Convulſions of the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> as being provok'd by the clotted Blood; and ſometimes ſwoonings, Proſtration of ſtrength, difficulty of Breathing, and Critical Impoſthumes about the Groin.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Thoſe for the Breaſt are a notable difficulty of Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a troubleſome Cough, a Pain and ſenſe of weight about the ſhort Ribs, an acute Feaver, and the coldneſs of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Parts.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thoſe which diſcover a Collection of clotted Blood in the Head, are a violent beating and pain in the Head; an involuntary Watryneſs of the Eyes, redneſs of the Face, diſorders of the Stomac, and critical Bleedings, at Mouth, Noſe or Ears. In all theſe Caſes ſhivering and the increaſe of the Feaver are ſigns of Suppuration. After the matter is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted it begins to float, and the feaveriſh Symptoms relent.</p>
                     <p>Of the <hi>Empyema</hi>'s that proceed from the efflux of Puru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Matter, from ſome Impoſthume into the Cavity, thoſe which follow the ſuppuration of a Pleurifie or <hi>Peripneumonia</hi> are moſt remarkable; and upon that account we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our ſelves with an account of their Symptoms, which may ſerve as a Pattern for all others.</p>
                     <p>The Impoſthume generally breaks about the twentieth, thirtieth, or fortieth Day; being attended by a ſhivering, high Feaver, a perpetual Cough with a hollow ſound, and a ſenſe of rebounding Matter, as being toſs'd by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions of the provok'd Midriff; and a difficulty of Breathing, with an oppreſſing heavineſs in the Breaſt when they Stand or Sit, of which they are freed when they lye on their Backs. When they ſtoop they're in danger of Suffocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:207638:194"/>by reaſon of the weight incumbent upon the Midriff. The Feaver which at firſt was acute becomes ſlow, hectic, and liable to nocturnal Exaſperations. They are ſubject to frequent Palpitations of the Heart, Anxieties of the Breaſt, nocturnal melting Sweats and Fluſhings in the Face, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Cheek of the ſame ſide with the part affected. When the diſtemper is far advanc'd, a rotten aſhy taſte in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades the Mouth. The Pulſe in the Wriſt of the ſame ſide intermits while that in the other obſerves its regular Periods. A ſoft Tumor frequently beſets the Ribs, which perhaps proceeds from the tranſpiration of the thinner part of the Matter, and the Patient finds moſt eaſe by lying on the ſame ſide.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſtic of <hi>Empyema</hi>'s; thoſe of the Brain attended by Vomiting are Mortal; nay oft-times the Patient dies before the clotted Blood come to a Head. Thoſe of the Abdomen are frequently diſcharg'd by Impoſthumes in the Groyn. Thoſe of the Breaſt, if they be not cur'd betimes, are apt to cauſe Phthiſics and Conſumptions. If white ſmooth Purulent Matter be voided by Stool or Urine, or copiouſly expectorated in an <hi>Empyema</hi> of the Breaſt; and if the Thirſt, Inappetency, Feaver, and difficulty of Breathing relent, 'tis a good Omen: But the reverſe of theſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances is fatal.</p>
                     <p>The Cure conſiſts in diſſolving and evacuating the clot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Blood, or promoting its ſuppuration, evacuating the <hi>Pus</hi> and reſtoring the injur'd part to its due ſtrength. As for the evacuating Indication, the efforts of Nature muſt be our Directory; as, if it incline to void the Matter by Urine, Sweat or Stool, it muſt be accordingly aſſiſted. If the clot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Blood be lodg'd in the Abdomen, we give it Vent by a <hi>Paracenteſis;</hi> if in the Breaſt, by opening the interval between the fifth and ſixth Ribs (reckoning downwards;) if in the Brain, by a Trepanation. All theſe Operations are both proper and ſafe, if they be perform'd betimes, and not put off till the Patient's ſtrength be exhauſted, or the Matter be alter'd, and render'd unfit for evacuation. If it come by a prick, we inlarge the Orifice of the Wound. If the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be Plethoric, and the Blood be apt to boyl high, or if the Evil was occaſion'd by a Fall or Bruiſe, Bleeding will be requiſit, eſpecially that for Revulſion, according to the Circumſtances of the part.</p>
                     <pb n="387" facs="tcp:207638:194"/>
                     <p>As for internal Medicines. The firſt in order are thoſe which diſſolve and diſengage clotty Blood. Such are the Decoction of Madder in Wine; the Tincture of the leſſer Daſies, the Decoction of the Roots, Leaves, and Flowers of Arnic in Ale, the Juice of the Herb Robert, <hi>Sperma Ceti</hi> given to a dram; Caſtor, the Blood of Goats given to a dram; Sparrow's Dung diſſolv'd in Vinegar, Man's fat melted given to half an ounce; the Herbs, Savin, Ground Ivy, Hyſſop, Chervil, Wormwood, St. <hi>John</hi>'s-wort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Roots of Angelica, Swallow-wort, Birth-wort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Seeds of <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> Chervil, and St. <hi>John</hi>'s-wort; the vulnerary Tinctures, Bezoar Stone, Diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retic Antimony, and in a word all abſorbent Powders, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Crabs diſſolv'd in Vinegar. Theſe Ingredients ought always to be mix'd with evacuating Medicines, that ſo the Blood when diſſolv'd may be readily voided. Thus if it be lodg'd in the Abdomen, or if nature incline to void it by Stool, we add Rhubarb and Laxatives; if in the Breaſt, we add Diuretics and Diaphoretics according to Nature's Motions. In general Diuretics are the moſt proper. The forms of Receipts are as follow.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Decoction of Ground Ivy, a pound; while 'tis yet warm infuſe in it over Night Rhubarb, one ounce; pick'd Senna Leaves, half an ounce; Salt of Tartar, half a dram. In the Morning ſtrain the Liquor, and add of the Powder of Crabs Eyes, a dram and a half; the Powder againſt Falls (preſcrib'd in the <hi>Ausberg</hi> Diſpenſatory) a dram.

                     <p>Having diſpatch'd the Cure of clotty Blood, which for the moſt part degenerats into <hi>Empyema</hi>'s, we proceed to that of an <hi>Empyema</hi> it ſelf, which conſiſts in evacuating the Purulent Matter, qualifying its ſharpneſs, and ſtrengthening the Part. The means for evacuation are either Natural or Artificial; the latter are mention'd above. The former are either Urine, Sweat, Stool or Spitting. <hi>Empyema</hi>'s of the Breaſt, (which may ſerve for a Pattern for all others, as to the Cure) for the moſt part empty themſelves, by Spitting and Urine, tho' the Paſſages, thro' which the Matter reaches either the Mouth or the Reins, are yet undiſcover'd. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever 'tis a Phyſician's part, when he deſcry's Purulent Urine, to exhibit Diuretics; and when the Matter moves upwards, and provokes Coughing, to adminiſter expectorating Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, or rather a Vomit, which is of wonderful Efficacy; ſuppoſing ſtill that there be no danger of a Spitting of Blood, for in that caſe it ought to be omitted, and ſhifted for expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorating Medicines, temper'd according as the Matter is ſharp or thick. As for the ſharpneſs of the Matter, 'tis ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably accounted for by exhibiting the Flowers and Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam of Sulphur, Balſam of <hi>Peru,</hi> Myrrh, and fix'd Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Sulphurs, ſuch as Diaphoretic Antimony, <hi>Poterius</hi>'s Antihectic, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The injuries done to the ſolid parts by the purulent Matter, are repair'd by Goats Milk, and by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions of Woods, Scabious, Chervil, and eſpecially Ground Ivy. But Vulnerary or Balmy Medicines are not to be exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited without ſuch as evacuate one way or another, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a particular regard to the Feaver that accompanies this Diſtemper. As for Example,</p>
                     <p>Take of Hyſſop and Scabious Water, of each an ounce and a half; the Flowers of Sulphur, half a dram; Diaphoretic Antimony, a ſcruple; Jovial Bezoar, half a ſcruple; Syrup of Tobacco, an ounce. Make a Potion for two Doſes. To which, if the Feaver be high, add a few Drops of the dulcify'd ſpirit of Nitre.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Water of red Poppies, three ounces; Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar of Wine, ſix drams; prepar'd Crabs Eyes, a dram; Diaphoretic Antimony, half a dram; Syrup of red Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Flowers, ſix drams. Make a Potion to be given by Spoonfuls.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Juice of Ground Ivy, four ounces: the Juice of Hore-hound, two ounces. With Sugar make a Syrup, to which add of Frankincenſe and choice Myrrh, of each a dram. Mix. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Decoction of China Roots, mix'd
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:207638:195"/>with Diaphoretic Antimony; or that of Guajacum, with the Juice of Ground-Ivy; or that of Ox-bones, with the Gelly of Hartshorn, are alſo very proper. The hot Balſams may be mix'd with Sugar of Lead when, heat prevails.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Shavings of Gujacum, an ounce; Saſſafras, half an Ounce; boil them in ſeven Pound of Common Water, 'till a Pound and a half be conſum'd. Then add Ground-Ivy, Flowers of St. <hi>John</hi>'s-wort, and the Herb Speed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, of each two handfuls; Liquorice-Roots, half an ounce; Fennel-ſeed, ſix drams; Corants bruis'd, three Ounces.

                     <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of Bleeding, or the Burſting of the Blood Veſſels.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE ſtagnation of the Blood in its own Veſſels, and its extravaſation in the Cavities of the Body, being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy diſpatch'd; it remains now to account for its effuſion out of the Body. The cauſes of which are, either</p>
                     <p n="1">1. An <hi>Anaſtomoſis,</hi> or ſpontaneous diſ-joining of the Capil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary Veſſels, and eſpecially of the Arteries, whoſe Blood in all natural bleedings runs by drops, as depending upon the ſucceſſive Pulſation of the Artery; whereas that of the Veins (which, for the moſt part, never burſt without a violent cauſe) runs with a conſtant and united Stream.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A <hi>Diaereſis,</hi> or Breaches violently made in the Veſſels, by external cutting, pricking, or bruiſing Inſtruments, by Cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Neeſing, Vomiting, or Crying by exceſſive Joy, Grief, and vehement Paſſions of the Mind, eſpecially in the flux of the Terms; by the Aſſumption or Inſpiration of ſharp corroſive things; Such as Hellebor, violent Purgatives, Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:207638:196"/>
                        <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and laſtly, by ſharp corroſive Humors incorporated with the Blood, which both fret the Blood, and gnaw its Veſſels, eſpecially in ſcorbutical Conſtitutions; the Fibres of whoſe Veſſels are lank and weak. Some Authors aſſign yet a third Cauſe of Bleeding, <hi>viz.</hi> A <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or the <hi>Tranſudation</hi> of the Blood thro' its Veſſels; but 'tis not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, that any Liquor ſo thick as Blood ſhould ſweat through the ſtrong touch Coats of the Veſſels, eſpecially thoſe of the Arteries, without a breach or <hi>Anaſtomoſis.</hi> 'Tis true, the thin Serum may glide thro' ſometimes; but the Conſiſtence of the Blood robs it of that Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                     <p>The remote Cauſes of an <hi>Anaſtomoſis,</hi> are</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A true Plethora or redundancy of Blood, as in the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Terms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. An apparent Plethora, or the Ebullition of the Blood, obliging it to diſtend its Veſſels, as in Feavers, and the Small Pox, or when Perſons drink much Generous Wine, or eat Aromatic Food, or imploy themſelves in any extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry exerciſe of the Body. This ebullition is moſt apt to cauſe a burſting of the Veſſels in fat Perſons, by reaſon that their Veſſels are ſtraiten'd by the incumbent Fat.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The thinneſs and ſeroſity of the Blood; which at once unbends the Fibres, and qualifies the Blood for making a Paſſage thro' 'em. In this caſe the Blood, when it runs out, appears thin and pale, whereas in other caſes 'tis brisk and florid. This ſeroſity of the Blood was by the Ancients charged to the Liver, as being tardy in its Office of ſanguifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; but as our later Anatomiſts have juſtly imploy'd the Liver for other uſes, ſo the imperfect Digeſtion in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac, and fermentation of the Chyle in the <hi>Duodenum,</hi> will naturally account for the want of conſiſtence in the Blood.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Convulſive Contractions of the Coats of the Veſſels, eſpecially the Arteries, which by ſtraitening one Branch, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion the extraordinary diſtention of the next. Thus ſple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netic Perſons are liable to vomiting of Blood, becauſe the Artery in the Spleen denies a free admiſſion to the Blood; and the obſtruction of the Blood in the Head is frequently remov'd by bleeding at Noſe.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Convulſive Contraction of the Parts, incompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Blood-Veſſels, which are apt to ſtraiten the Veſſels, eſpecially the <hi>Veins,</hi> that are leaſt able to reſiſt their force.</p>
                     <p>Critical and cuſtomary effuſions of Blood, or ſuch as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſuppreſſion of a wonted Evacution, are not to be
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:207638:196"/>ſtopp'd, without they exceed meaſure. When a Bleeding is attended by a ſenſible pulſation of ſome adjacent Artery, 'tis a ſign that it proceeds from the Compreſſion or Contraction of that Artery. Bleedings at Noſe are uſher'd in by a giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, redneſs of the Eyes, involuntary Tears, tingling of the Ears, itching of the Noſe, a hard Pulſe, a violent Pain, and ſenſible pulſation of the Arteries in the Head and Neck. A flux of Blood from the Wind-pipe is introduc'd by a Cough, and difficult Reſpiration. That from the Womb, by the diſtention, weight, and heat of the Abdomen and Loins, happening about the menſtrual period; and that from the Haemorrhoid Veins, by a Pulſation in the Hypocondria, Back, and Loins, and a Tumor and Pain in the Veins, with a <hi>Teneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſtic, a <hi>Diaereſis</hi> is worſe than an <hi>Anaſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſis;</hi> and Bleedings from external Cauſes, are more favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than thoſe from internal. In Melancholic and Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic Conſtitutions, eſpecially when the Bleeding renders the Face Limon-colour'd, or is follow'd by Convulſions and Swoonings, it prognoſticates Dropſies, Conſumptions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for Cure, The various cauſes muſt be remov'd by proper Medicines; a <hi>Plethora</hi> by Bleeding, Scarifying, and a thin Diet: The Ebullition of the Blood by ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines as temper a volatil Acid, as Vinegar, Spirit of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, Nitre diſſolv'd in Water; the Tincture of the Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Daſies, the Sugar of Lead, the Antiphthiſical Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, Coral, ſeal'd Earth, Purſlain, Plaintain, Opium, Camphyr, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſeroſity of the Blood by thickening In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, and ſuch as evacuate Serum, either by Stool, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, or Sweat. The Convulſive Contractions of the Blood-Veſſels by Chalybeats. The ſharpneſs of Blood, by tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat Medicines, ſuch as Milk, Raiſins, Steel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſion of the Veſſels, by vulnerary Aſtringents: The Laxity of the Parts, by corroborating things, ſuch as Aſs-Dung, the Ankle of a Hogg; <hi>Crollius</hi> his Powder <hi>Sperniola;</hi> Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, Steel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> However, we ought to obſerve,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That Bloodletting is only proper, when the Blood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds or boils too high, and 'tis better to bleed often, for <hi>Revulſion, Derivation,</hi> and <hi>Averſion,</hi> than to draw forth much at once. Sometimes Ligatures and Cupping-Glaſſes applied at a convenient diſtance from the Part, are not amiſs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That Purgatives are only proper when the Blood is too ſerous; and in that caſe, eſpecially if it be accompanyed by a Feaver, Diaphoretics mix'd with Opiats are of good
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:207638:197"/>uſe; as being apt to thicken the Blood after the Swelling is over, tho' in the time of ſwearing they rather attenuate and diſſolve it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Opiats are good in all Caſes.</p>
                     <p>From theſe Premiſes we infer, that the internal Medicines that are proper againſt Bleeding, are the vulnerary Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, abſorbent Powders (eſpecially Steel, which is both Aſtringent and Anti-acid to a notable Degree.) Diureticks and Purgatives in ſerous Caſes, and temperat Ingredients, eſpecially Raiſins, and Milk, for mitigating the ſharp Humours. The Medicines which jointly anſwer theſe ends, are either of the Vegetable, Mineral, or Animal Families. Thoſe of the Vegetable Province are Plantan, Purſlain, the Syrups of Comfrey, Ground-Ivy, and Myrtle-berries; the Syrup made of the Juice of the Root of Baſtard Acorus with Sugar; The freſh Juice of the common ſtinging Nettle, given to two or three Ounces; the Moſs of Man's Skull given to a ſcruple, or half a dram, in the Water of Shepherds Purſe, with the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of Coral; Maſtic, Sarcocol, Amber, Frankincenſe, Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins, Camphyr, Opium, and Rhubarb, which not only e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuats the Serum, but corrects the craſis of the Blood. Dragon's Blood, if it be Genuin, is very proper; but ſince 'tis generally adulterated with ſome noxious ſtuff, we ought to avoid it.</p>
                     <p>The Mineral Province preſents us with Coral, Bole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menic, Nitre, Spirit of Vitriol, Sugar of Lead, the Powder of Blood-ſtone mix'd with Vinegar, or the Juice of Pomgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nats, the Vitriol of Steel mix'd with Sugar of Lead, <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s Aſtringent Extract of Steel, given to nine Grains; the Spaw-waters, or in want of them, the ſolar Liquor of ſteel; and above all, the Tincture of the Sulphur of Vitriol pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd thus;</p>
                     <p>Take of the Native Genuin Vitriol of Steel that's void of all Copper, and diſſolve it in Water, (if the Vitriol be not genuin, put the filings of Steel into the Water, and 'twill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitat the Copper; and then the ſtrain'd Liquor being thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd, will yield the genuin Vitriol of Steel) when the Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol is diſſolv'd in Water, pour into it the Oyl of Tartar <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> or the Lie of the Salt of Tartar, and 'twill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitat an Aſtringent Crocus of Steel, which ought to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently dulcifi'd with Water, and dry'd; then diſſolv'd in the Spirit of Nitre, and after the Spirit of Nitre is drawn off, the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> digeſted with rectin'd Spirit of Wine gives the Tincture, which is of admirable uſe againſt all
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:207638:197"/>Bleedings. Its Doſe is thirty or forty Drops in a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Vehicle.</p>

                        <p>In regulating the Method of Cure, we muſt have a particular regard to the various Cauſes, <hi>viz.</hi> the redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy, turgeſcence, ſeroſity, or ſharpneſs of the Blood; and ſingle out proper Medicines, according to the Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:207638:198"/>given for Bleedings in general. To which we ſhall only add this one Obſervation, that in habitual Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at Noſe, freſh Mint, or its Juice taken frequently, is of ſingular uſe.</p>
                        <p>Externally we endeavour to divert and appeaſe the Spirits, to curb the turgeſcence of the Blood, and to ſhut the Orifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Veſſels. For compaſſing the firſt Deſign, we uſe painful Ligatures, Frights, Cauſtics appli'd to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote parts, cold things ſuddenly apply'd to the <hi>Scrotum</hi> or Breaſt; a dry'd Toad hung under the Armpits, or tied to the Forehead, or its Powder applied to the Noſtrils; a Blood-ſtone, or genuin Jaſper, held in the Hand 'till it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come warm; Aſh-wood applied to the Noſtrils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the ſecond end, we ſometimes Bleed by way of Revulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Derivation; or apply ſcarifying Cupping-Glaſſes to the Neck, or to the Calf of the Leg; thoſe which the Antients order'd for the Liver and Spleen, being very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and of no uſe.

As for the third Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſhutting the Orifices of the Veſſels, we blow into the Noſtrils the Powder of Allum or Vitriol, mix'd with Painters <hi>Lac,</hi> or apply it with a Tent dipp'd into the White of an Egg; or into the Juice of Hoggs-Dung, mix'd with Juice of Plantan. The Powder of Hoggs-Dung, and that of Toads, are very proper for the ſame uſe; as likewiſe the Phlegm of Vitriol, writing Ink, the Tincture of the Sulphur of Vitriol; Soot taken from the bottom of a Kettle, and mix'd with the Powder of the Blood that runs from the Noſtrils; the <hi>French</hi> Styptic Liquor, or a ſolution of Allum and Vitriol of Steel in Plantan-Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and above all, the rectifi'd Spirit of Wine.</p>
                        <p>The Gums are alſo very liable to Bleedings, occaſion'd by the laxity of their Subſtance, or the Corroſion of ſharp ſcorbutical ſpittle, or the drawing of a Tooth, or by the general Cauſes of other bleedings. If their bleeding be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riodical, cuſtomary, or critical, it ought not to be ſtop'd. If it be caus'd by the drawing of a Tooth, apply the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:207638:199"/>of the Sulphur of Vitriol with Cotton; and gargle the Mouth with the Decoction of Tormentil, and Snake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weed-roots, with Galls, and White Poppy-ſeeds in Water, mixing it with Bole-Armenic, Allum, and a little Vinegar. Sometimes the Spirit of Salt mix'd with Water is uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for waſhing the Mouth. But when every other thing proves ineffectual, an actual Cautery is the ſureſt Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Scorbutical Bleedings are accounted for elſewhere.</p>

                        <p>THE Blood that is evacuated by ſpitting, may either proceed from the Stomac, (of which elſewhere) or from the Palat, Noſtrils, and Gums, as was related in the laſt Article; or from the Organs of Reſpiration, <hi>viz.</hi> the Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe, Bronchia or Lungs; in which caſe, the Diſeaſe is called (<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>) <hi>Hemoptyſis,</hi> or a ſpitting of Blood, and is the ſubject of this Paragraph. The general Cauſes are already accounted for: The particular Cauſes are,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Rupture of ſome Veſſel in the Breaſt, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd by a redundancy of Blood, ſuppreſſion of the Terms or Piles, violent Crying, bearing heavy Burdens, Falls, Blows, vehement Coughing, or immoderat Laughter.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Corroſion of the Veſſels in the Breaſt, eſpecially in the Lungs, occaſion'd by the Inſpiration of Mineral Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous ſteams; or by a ſharp Lymph reigning in the Body, as in the ſmall Pox, or when a ſordid Ulcer is unſeaſonably dry'd. To theſe we may add the accidental ſwallowing of Leeches, and immoderat Bathing.</p>
                        <p>A Spitting of Blood is of it ſelf manifeſt: But to trace out the part from whence it proceeds is a piece of Difficulty. For this end the Phyſician ought to weigh the antecedent Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſuch as exceſſive Crying, Falls, Bruiſes of the Breaſt, and violent Coughs, which generally arraign the Lungs, while other Cauſes are apt to affect other parts. Beſides the Circumſtances attending the Evacuation, will give ſome further light into the Matter; as if the Blood be clotty, if it be voided without Coughing or much Hauking, and that in ſmall quantities, then it proceeds from the Palat,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:207638:199"/>Gums, Throat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not from the Breaſt, If it be copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly voided with a Cough that not only accompanies but precedes the evacuation, and makes a hollow Noiſe, then it comes from the Wind-pipe or Lungs; and if the reſpiration be difficult, if the Blood be florid, thin, and frothy (as being rarify'd by the Air,) and if a pain beſet the lower part of the Breaſt, it certainly takes its riſe from the Lungs. If the Blood be black, clotty, and thick, and voided with a Cough and hollow Noiſe, it ſprings from the Veins in the Cavity of the Breaſt. As for the Prognoſtic; A Spitting of Blood from the Lungs is moſt dangerous, and apt to degenerat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Phthiſic or Ulcer of the Lungs, eſpecially if it took its riſe from the Corroſion of a ſharp Humor. If it be only a Symptom of another Diſeaſe, as of a Pleuriſie, <hi>Peripneumonia,</hi> &amp;c. it is not ſo dangerous, as when it ſtands upon its own Legs. If a Spitting of Blood, occaſion'd by a ſuppreſſion of wonted evacuations, or by the Turgeſcence of Blood, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably ſtop'd, it degenerats into a <hi>Peripneumonia,</hi> or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
                        <p>The Cure is perform'd in the Paroxyſm, by removing the cauſe, appeaſing and thickening the Blood, and repairing the loſſes of the Veſſels: out of the Paroxyſm, the clotty Blood remaining in the Breaſt, ought to be diſcuſs'd, and the Lungs ſtrengthen'd. Now in order to anſwer theſe Indications, let's mind the following Rules.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. When a Spitting of Blood is caus'd by the Corroſion of ſharp humors, Blood-letting is improper; in ſome other caſes it may be ſerviceable, but regard muſt ſtill be had to the Rules of Revulſion and Averſion; as if it proceed from the ſuppreſſion of the Piles or Terms, a Vein muſt be open'd in the Leg: When it ariſes from the ſuppreſſion of a cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Bleeding at Noſe, the vein of the Fore-head, or that under the Tongue is the proper place.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Purgatives are highly pernicious. But Diuretics and Diaphoretics are very uſeful.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Internal Aſtringents ought not to be us'd, before the Blood be turn'd off, for fear of impriſoning the Blood in the Breaſt, and ſo cauſing a Suffocation, or <hi>Peripneumonia.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. All external Aſtringents and cold things applied to the Breaſt, are more apt to enflame than mitigat the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Opiats are always ſafe and uſeful; but ſuch of 'em as are very hot, as Venice Treacle, Mithridat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:207638:200"/>as <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> and eſpecially Henbane Seeds, which are unanimouſly approv'd both by the ancient and modern Writers. Hence an Electuary of Henbane and white Poppy Seeds, with Coral, Blood-ſtone, and the ſtale Conſerve of Roſes, is of excellent uſe. However the ſafeſt way is to give but a ſmall quantity of Henbane Seeds at a time, and repeat the Doſes oftner, becauſe they are very Narcotic, and apt to cauſe Madneſs.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. In all Compoſitions we ought ſtill to have an Eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the corroſive ſharpneſs of the Humors, for tempering which we uſe the ſame Medicines as were recommended againſt Bleedings in general; eſpecially Plantan, Purſlain and Comfrey, their Decoctions, Juices and Syrups, for their Waters have no aſtringent force: The Decoction, Syrup, and Conſerve of Ground Ivy (a noble Pectoral,) the Juice of Nettles, the ſtale Conſerve of red Roſes, <hi>Diaſcordium,</hi> the Troches of Amber, (which at once temper ſharp humors, diſſolve clotty Blood, and ſtop its Flux:) The Oyl of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed given by Spoonfuls, the Oyl of Vitriol when there's no apprehenſion of a Phthiſic; the Juice expreſs'd from Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces boyl'd in Water till they be ſoft, given to two or three Spoonfuls, three or four times a Day; the Decoction it ſelf being mix'd with that of Barly, or Corants for ordinary Drinking; Mice Dung, given to a dram, twice a Day, with the Juice of Plantan and Sugar; the Tincture of the Sulphur of Vitriol, Bloodſtone, the Antiphthiſical Tincture, <hi>Mynſichtius</hi>'s Species <hi>Diaplantaginis,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. When the Paroxyſm is over, we ought to add diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and expectorating Medicines, ſuch as <hi>Sperma Ceti,</hi> Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoretic Antimony, Crabs Eyes with Vinegar, Oyl of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Oxymel of Squills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">8. In the laſt place the Lungs ought to be fortify'd by Vulnerary Balmy Medicines.</p>
                        <p>As for external Applications ſome apply a dry'd Toad un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Arm-pits; ſome truſt to the Sympathetic Powder of Vitriol; and others chooſe to wet or waſh the Teſticles with Roſe Vinegar, and that with good ſucceſs.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Conſerve of Ground Ivy, and that of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey, of each an ounce; Conſerve of Roſes, an ounce; ſeal'd Earth impregnated with ſpirit of Vitriol, (providing the Lungs are not corroded) two ſcruples; prepar'd Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, a ſcruple; Troches of Amber, a dram; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> ſix grains. With the Syrup of Comfrey make an

                        <p>Take of Plantan, Purſlain, and Chervil Waters, of each an ounce; Tincture of the Sulphur of Vitriol, a dram; Troches of Amber, two ſcruples; <hi>Crollius</hi>'s <hi>Sperniola,</hi> fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen grains; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> five grains; <hi>Fernelius</hi>'s Syrup of Comfrey, and the Syrup of Purſlain, of each half an ounce.

                  <p>AS the Blood viſits the Bowels for their nouriſhment, ſo it is variouſly alter'd according to the Nature of every Bowel. In the Spleen 'tis impregnated with a Volatil ſour Ferment, that prepares and qualifies its parts for ſeparation; in the Liver 'tis ſeparated from the Bile, which is convey'd thence int othe Gut, either directly thro' the <hi>Ductus He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paticus,</hi> or, after ſome ſtay in the Gall-bag, thro' the <hi>Ductus Cyſticus.</hi> Now there are ſeveral Caſes in which this ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is lamely perform'd, <hi>viz.</hi> When the Animal Spirits are exhauſted or diſorder'd, or the innate Spirits of the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective Bowel vitiated; or when Inflammations or Tumors invade the Part, as in Chronical Diſeaſes; not, as if the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions or Tumors of the Spleen or Liver were the Cauſes of Chronical Diſtempers, but only as being their effects, or at leaſt troubleſome Companions, that ought to be accounted for in the Cure of thoſe Diſtempers, it being generally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd by Chalybeats, or ſuch Medicines as conquer an Acid, and clear the firſt Paſſages, which are the Original Source of all Obſtructions.</p>

                  <p>In the Kidneys, the Blood being carry'd thither by the <hi>Emulgent</hi> Arteries, is diſſolv'd by a lixivious Ferment, and its Serum laden with acid and urinous Salts, invelop'd with Oily Particles, is ſtrain'd thro' the ſmall Fibres that convey it to the <hi>Corpus Papillare,</hi> from whence it ſweats through into the <hi>Pelvis,</hi> and paſſing thro' the Ureters and Bladder, is voided under the name of <hi>

But ſo ſoon as the Blood has conquer'd the prevailing hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous Salt that over-match'd and diſturb'd the Harmony of the reſt, then the Urine precipitats 'em as a Sediment, and becomes clear. In perfect Health, it contains nothing but theſe Salts incorporated with Oyl and a ſerous Vehicle, but when the Chyle is not elaborat or perfectly digeſted, then its Crudities, and the Sulphureous vicious Salts occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd by them, are voided with the Serum, and impart to it a high or flat Tincture, according to the various Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Salts, and their mixture with Sulphur.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>THE Cauſes of an <hi>Iſchuria</hi> in the Kidneys relate either to the Blood or the Kidneys. The former are the Redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy of the Blood, or its vicious thickneſs and the cloſe Coheſion of its Parts, occaſion'd by Acid or viſcous Lymph, and an imperfect Fermentation, as in Feavers before the Height, in Chronical Diſeaſes, obſtructions of the Bowels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The latter relating to the Kidneys are,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Obſtruction of their Paſſages, occaſion'd by clot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Blood, as in the caſe of a Fall; Purulent Matter either reſiding there, or convey'd thither from other Ulcers; viſcid tough Humors, a Stone in the Kidneys, exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal cold contracting the Fibres, nephritic Tumors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Paralytic Laxity of the Fibres, occaſion'd by a weakneſs or deficiency of Spirits, by preceding Wounds or Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, by the diſorders of their Nerves, the diſlocation of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Back, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Convulſive Contractions of the Fibres, which are frequently occaſion'd in one Kidney by a Stone in the other, thro' the correſpondence of the Nerves.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The flatneſs of the Ferment in the Kidneys, or its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy from a volatil ſalin Acrimony, as in Dropſies, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chexies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="402" facs="tcp:207638:202"/>
                        <p>A Suppreſſion of Urine ariſing from the default of the Kidneys is diſtinguiſh'd from that in the Bladder, by a ſenſe of weight about the Loyns, the inſufficiency of a <hi>Catheter</hi> for procuring Urine, and the abſence of a Tumor or pain about the Pubes or <hi>Perinaeum;</hi> ſometimes 'tis attended by ſtinking Sweats, or ſuch as ſmell like Urine; a ſtinking Breath, Anxieties in the Breaſt, Vomiting, an univerſal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummedneſs, Epileptic Symptoms, and Tumors of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen and Legs. If the Urine before the ſuppreſſion was thick and muddy, with a copious ſlimy Sediment, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being univerſally infeſted with tough coarſe Humors, then the ſuppreſſion is caus'd by Slime ſtopping the Paſſages. If the Urine before the ſuppreſſion was Bloody, or if a Blow, Fall, or violent Riding occaſion'd it, then clotted Blood is the immediat Cauſe. If the Urine was mix'd with Purulent Matter, or if any conſiderable Bowel be ulcerated, the Obſtruction is caus'd by the corrupt Matter. If the Urine was voided without any other remarkable Symptom, than that of loſing its wonted Smell and Taſte, the Ferment is faulty.</p>
                        <p>An <hi>Iſchuria</hi> in the Kidneys is worſe than that in the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. If it be attended by Symptoms diſturbing the Breaſt, 'tis very dangerous. If the Urine force its Paſſage before the <hi>Seventh</hi> day, it affords a comfortable Prediction, tho' not infallible, eſpecially if the Blood and ſolid Parts be much corrupted: Some Inſtances there are of a total ſuppreſſion of Urine, for ten, fourteen, or twenty Days, that was cur'd; but theſe are unfrequent; beſides, they are generally attended by a perpetual Sweating, Vomiting, or ſome notable eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation of Serum, otherwiſe they would prove Mortal. If a ſuppreſſion of Urine be free from pain, it proceeds from the Paralytic Laxity of the Fibres, and is always Mortal.</p>
                        <p>The Cure varys according to the Difference of the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. In general, gentle Laxatives mix'd with Diuretics and Turpentin Clyſters are proper, as being apt not only to irritat the Guts, but to promote Urine. If the Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be caus'd by clotty Blood; Madder, <hi>Sperma Ceti,</hi> Crabs Eyes mix'd with Vinegar, Chervil, Ground Ivy, St. <hi>John</hi>'s-wort, eſpecially its Seed, and above all the volatil Salt of Amber, are proper Ingredients. If the Obſtruction be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd by Purulent Matter, we exhibit the Balſam of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur prepar'd with Oyl of Turpentin, the Eſſence of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimony,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:207638:202"/>Juice of Ground Ivy, and ſuch like vulnerary Medicines. If a ſlimy humor beſet the Kidneys, we muſt firſt evacuat the ſlimy Crudities by Laxatives, before we attempt to uſe Diuretics, for fear they ſhould augment the Evil, as cauſing a greater afflux of pituitous Matter. After eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation we adminiſter the Juice of Radiſhes, the Infuſion of Horſe Radiſhes in Wine, the Juice of Limons to two or three ounces, with Oxymel; the dulcify'd ſpirit of Salt, the Philoſophical ſpirit of Vitriol, or rather the Acid ſpirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> with the Decoction of Parſley Roots and red Vetches; the Juice of the Pellitory that grows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rubbiſh of old Walls, as being impregnated with the Nitrous Salt of the Lime; the Winter Cherry, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, volatil Salt of Amber, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If the Fibres of the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys be flaggy, Aromatic and Nervous Medicines are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, eſpecially Turpentin, the ſpirit and Oyl of Juniper-berries, Cinnabar of Antimony, and above all the volatil Salt of Amber given to twelve grains in a Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Vehicle is an admirable Diuretic. If the Fibres be contracted we exhibit Narcotics, with Cinnabar of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, and the volatil Salt of Amber; or Mithridat with ſome diuretic Decoction; or, in imitation of <hi>Geſnerus,</hi> the Powder of Glaſs.</p>
                        <p>If the ferment of the Kidneys be defective, we exhibit the ſharp ſalin Diuretics, mix'd with the temperat Oily Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients; eſpecially the Decoction of Garlic Heads, the Seed of Hedge Muſtard given to a dram in Wine, the Juice of Parſneps, the Spirit and Salt of Urine; <hi>Amelungius</hi>'s nephritic Tincture, prepar'd from Tartar, Nitre, Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and the ſolar Flint-ſtones; the Carminative Spirit, the volatil ſpirit of Tartar; the ſpirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil Salt or diſtill'd Oyl of Amber; the Spirit or Juice of Earth-worms; the Powder, Juice and Infuſion of Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice; the Infuſion of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Flies in Wine, or their Diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retic Eſſence prepar'd with the Tincture of Tartar; the Infuſion of Horſes Dung in Rheniſh Wine; the Urine of a Goat; Crabs Eyes mix'd with Wine or Vinegar; the Decoctions of red Vetches, Chervil, Madder, or St. <hi>John</hi>'s-wort; the Shells of Hens Eggs or rather thoſe of Eſtrich Eggs, given to a dram, or diſſolv'd in ſpirit of Salt; the Powder of Snails Shells diſſolv'd in like manner; the fix'd Salts of Diuretic Plants, prepar'd according to <hi>Tachenius</hi>'s Method; or ſo that
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:207638:203"/>they be not too much calcin'd, and conſequently rob'd of their Salin Vertue; the Tincture of Tartar, prepar'd thus.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Salt of Tartar, two ounces; diſſolve 'em in Water, then ſtrain, and ſet it upon the Fire; while 'tis a boyling, throw into it by degrees three ounces of the Cream of Tartar in Powder; then thicken 'em with a gentle Fire, and afterward reduce 'em to Powder, from which extract an admirable Diuretic Tincture with the ſpirit of Wine.</p>
                        <p>To theſe we may add the Juice of the Birch-tree, the diſtill'd Oyl of Turpentin, and Emulſions made of violet Seeds, and Speedwell Water, or of Turpentin and the yelk of an Egg, with ſome Diuretic Water, and the Juice of Limons. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Waters of Parſley, and Reſtharrow, of each an ounce; Elixyr of Juniper-berries, (call'd <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaticum</hi>) ſix drams; ſpirit of Putrified Earth-worms, two drams; volatil ſpirit of Tartar, a dram; diſtill'd Oyl of Turpentin, three drops; Syrup of Ground Ivy, two or three drams. Mix and exhibit a Spoonful now and then.</p>
                        <p>Take of Tartar vitriolated, a dram; of the Salt of Bean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalks, and Salt of Pigeons Dung, of each fifteen grains; volatil Salt of Amber, twelve grains. Make a Powder for three Doſes.</p>
                        <p>Externally we anoint with Stone Oyl, Oyl of Scorpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and diſtill'd Oyl of Turpentin, mix'd with the Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Marſh-mallows.</p>

                        <head>ART. 2. <hi>Of the Stone in the Kidneys.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>STones in Man's Body, are nothing elſe but a vicious A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid congeal'd with a volatil Alcali. This vicious Acid, for the moſt part, is bred in the Stomac, and being mix'd with the Blood, attacks a naked volatil Alcali wherever it meets it, with which it conſpires to make up a third Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete or Stone. Now the Kidneys being plentifully ſtock'd with a volatil Alkali, are moſt liable to the ſhocks of this Acid. 'Tis true, that in a healthy ſtate, the Alcali of the Urine in the Kidneys, is naturally qualifi'd with an Acid, and then 'tis ſecure from the efforts of the vicious Intruder; but for as much as the Urine is oft-times liable to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, or Corruption, which ſets the volatil Salt at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, much after the ſame method as when it has been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the Air in an Urinal and begins to ſmell; therefore the Kidneys are in ſuch caſes in danger of being moleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Stones. Thus the generation of a Stone ſuppoſes two concurring Cauſes; one is a prevailing Acid in the Body, occaſion'd moſtly by imperfect Digeſtions in the firſt Paſſages, or by ſuch things as are apt to become Acid; <hi>viz.</hi> Milk, Cheeſe, and eſpecially Wine: The other is the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction and liberty of the volatil Alkali of the Urine; occaſion'd generally by the weakneſs of the Ferment, as by <hi>Aſparagus</hi> and ſuch Diuretics as enfeeble the Ferment, and cauſe a putrid ſmell in the Urine.</p>
                        <p>Now, that a volatil Acid engag'd with the volatil Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li in the Kidneys is apt to become a Stone, is made out by the following Remarks.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Arthritick and Melancholick Perſons, who are much moleſted with vicious Acids, are very liable to the Stone; whereas thoſe of a bilious Conſtitution are not.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Thoſe who live near the <hi>Danube,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e wont to drink much Wine, are frequently troubled with the Stone, by reaſon of the prevailing Acid in Wine, which is apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geal with a volatil Alcali; as, if ye take Nitre very well ſix'd, and mix it with Flint-ſtones, then melt it upon a ſtrong Fire, and 'twill become like Glaſs; pulverize this Glaſs, and pour Spirit of Wine upon it; after ſome time, pour that
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:207638:204"/>off, and add freſh Spirit of Wine, which in a Month's time will become a red Oil, containing the Acid of the Nitre exalted with the Spirit of Wine. Now if ye put a few Drops of this volatil Acid Oyl into a Glaſs of Wine, 'twill gather it into a hard ſubſtance.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Chymical Analyſis of the Stones preſents us with a fetil Oyl, an Urinous Spirit, a volatil Salt, and a <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> like Quick-lime: Not to ſpeak of its efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence with any Alcalin Salt.</p>
                        <p>When the Stones thus ingendered of the volatil Acid and Alcali are growing together, they ſometimes take in a viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid Mucilage, being the deprav'd nouriſhment of the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, which renders the ſtones white: Sometimes they cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode the ſmall Veſſels, and take in ſome drops of Blood, which makes the ſtones red. Sometimes the pure Salts join together, without any other mixture but ſome earthy Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, caus'd by the Putrefaction of the Urine, and then the Stones are yellow. But at other times the Membranes, and the whole ſubſtance of the Kidney, make a part of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete.</p>
                        <p>A Stone in the Kidneys, while it lies quiet and does not ſtir, is attended by few or no Symptoms. But when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to move, or, as the Practitioners ſpeak, <hi>in the Paroxyſm,</hi> it grates upon the Membranes, which by means of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat Correſpondence of their Nerves with all thoſe from the <hi>Meſenteric Plexus,</hi> communicat their diſorder to all the adjacent Parts. When its motion in the Kidney firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences, the Perſon is moleſted with a heavy dull Pain in the Loins, inclining to the right or left ſide, and ſometimes reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the reſpective ſide of the Head, according as the right or left Kidney is diſturb'd. When the Stone is advanc'd from the <hi>Pelvis</hi> to the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>reter,</hi> then the Pain ſhoots, pricks, and raiſes a ſenſe of diſtention, or tearing, and does not ceaſe 'till it either reaches the Bladder, or retire to the Kidney. Immediately before the invaſion of the Paroxyſm, the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine is ſcanty, watry, and very ſharp. Sometimes when the Stone is in motion, the nutritious Juice of the membranous Parts being deprav'd, is voided together with the Urine, rendring it thick, pale, and glutinous, eſpecially towards the bottom of the Urinal. Sometimes 'tis high tinctur'd, and thick, as being copiouſly impregnated with diſſolv'd Salts; ſometimes 'tis actually mix'd with Blood, by reaſon of the Stone's offenſiveneſs to the Blood-Veſſels. Oft-times Sand is
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:207638:204"/>alſo voided, but then it falls to the bottom, and is hard, not friable; otherwiſe if the Sand be friable and reddiſh, it is only a Coagulation of ſcorbutical Salts: ſometimes the Urine is totally ſuppreſs'd, the other Kidney being contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the provok'd Nerves.</p>
                        <p>During the Paroxyſm, the Perſon is unable to ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, or bow his Body, and the Pain glides along the Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Bladder; ſometimes it draws up the Teſticle, and benums the Leg of the ſame ſide; ſometimes it cauſes vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, inappetency, contractions of the Fingers, a tickling pain in the Nut of the Yard, and difficult reſpiration, the Midriff being by ſympathy affected, and girding the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſhort Ribs with a ſenſe of conſtriction. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, the moſt common Symptoms are, gripings in the Guts, Colick Pains in Men, Hyſteric Symptoms in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and in ſuch as are high-belly'd Pains reſembling thoſe of Child-birth. The Pulſe for the moſt part is hard, by reaſon of the convulſive Contractions of the Fibres of the Arteries. All theſe Symptoms are not always to be met with, neither are they peculiar to this Diſeaſe; but thoſe which are moſt certain, and diſtinguiſh this Diſtemper from the Colick, are the benum'dneſs of the Leg, inability to ſtand upright, or to ſtretch their Back, the continuance of the Pain without remiſſion, the diſorders of the Urine, and the abſence of the Symptoms peculiar to the Colick.</p>
                        <p>A Stone in the Kidneys is a dangerous Diſeaſe, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Women with Child. If frequently cauſes mortal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, Suppreſſions of Urine, Inflammations and Ulcers in the Kidneys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> eſpecially if it be rough and large. If the Urine, that was at firſt thin, becomes thick and mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as being laden with Sand and ſmall Stones, 'tis a good ſign. But if the Urine be ſuppreſs'd for a conſiderable time, and if the external Parts be cold, or ſeiz'd with cold Sweats, Death is at hand. Sometimes the Pains obſerve a <hi>Tertian</hi> or <hi>Quartan</hi> period. If they cauſe a Lethargy 'tis incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                        <p>The Cure conſiſts in mitigating the Pain, and removing the Contractions of the Ureters and Membranes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling the Stone by Diuretics. For which end, we ought to obſerve,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That all violent Diuretics are improper, while the Pain is vehement; for that they provoke and irritate the Membranes, to contract 'emſelves more. Wherefore while
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:207638:205"/>the Pain laſts, we give only the moſt temperate meek Diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics mix'd with Opiats.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That oily things, ſuch as Emulſions <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary for allaying the ſharpneſs of the Urine. The Ancients indeed recommended 'em for relaxating the Paſſages, but 'twas a groundleſs Fancy: To be ſure if they had any relaxating virtue, they would firſt diſplay it upon the Stomac.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That the firſt Paſſages ought always to be kept clear, leſt their impurities ſhould aggravate the Symptoms of the Abdomen. Upon this Account, emollient and anodyn Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are very ſerviceable, eſpecially in the beginning of the Paroxyſm. Such are thoſe of the Decoction of Speed-well, Camomil-flowers, Marſh-mallow-roots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in Milk; or of Rape and Lin-ſeed-Oyl; but we ought to take notice, that the ſimpleſt Decoctions are beſt; that large quantities muſt not be injected, eſpecially in high-belly'd Women, for fear of diſtending the Parts, and aggravating the Pain; and that if the Belly be very coſtive, we may add Purgative Electua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and when the Pain is abated, Juniper-Berries, volatil Salt of Amber, and ſuch like Diuretics. After the injection of Clyſters, we order Baths and Fomentations of the Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of ſoft'ning, carminative, cephalic, and diuretic In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients; follow'd by emollient relaxating Liniments, ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd with diſtill'd cephalic and diuretic Oyls. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of Pellitory, a handful; Mallows and Violets, of each half a handful; Chamomil and Elder-flowers, of each two little handfuls; Marſh-mallow-roots, ſix drams; boil them in Child's Urine, or Whey. To eight Ounces of the ſtrain'd Decoction, add of Turpentin diſſolv'd with the Yelk of an Egg, two drams; Oyl of White Lillies, half an ounce; Oyl of Scorpions, a dram; Antimonial Nitre, two ſcruples. Make a Clyſter.</p>
                        <p>Take of the emollient Ingredients, three handfuls; of the four large hot Seeds, and Salt of Tartar, of each a dram; boil them in Water. To nine Ounces of the ſtrain'd Liquor, add of the Electuary of Hiera with Agaric, an Ounce; Diſtill'd Oyl of Turpentin, a dram; with the Yelk of an Egg make a Clyſter.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Herbs, Mallows, Marſh-mallows, Pellitory, and Mercury, of each two handfuls; Chamomil and Elder-Flowers, of each two handfuls; Juniper-Berries, two oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; Lin-ſeed and Fenugrec-ſeed, of each three ounces;
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:207638:205"/>make two Bags to be boyl'd in Water for a Bath, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the time of bathing, one Bag to the Loyns, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Navel.</p>
                        <p>Take of Sage, Mother of Thyme, and Chamomil-flowers, of each two handfuls; Juniper-berries, two ounces; Seeds of Anis and Dill, of each an ounce. Tye 'em in a Bag, to be boyl'd in Water; foment the Loyns and Abdomen with the Decoction, and apply the Bags as above.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Ointment of Marſh-mallows, three drams; Oyl of bitter Almonds, and Oyl of Scorpions, of each a dram and a half; Rock Oyl, two drams. Make a Liniment. With which anoint the Loyns, Navel, and Region of the Ureters.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Oyls of bitter Almonds, Chamomil, white Lillies, and Scorpions, of each two drams; white Rock-Oyl, three drams; diſtill'd Oyls of Spike, and Juniper-berries. of each a dram and a half. Make an Ointment as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</p>
                        <p>Take of Rock-oyl, three drams; expreſs'd Oyl of Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, a dram and a half; expreſs'd Oyl of Henbane, half a dram. Make an Anodyn Liniment. The Eſſence of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium is uſeful for the ſame purpoſe. The nervous Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalic Oyls, the diſtill'd Oyls of Turpentin, Cummin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are alſo very proper. But above all, the Oyl of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyr is an admirable Diuretic for external Compoſitions. The Oyl of Amber is too fierce, and apt to aggravat the pain.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Plaiſter call'd <hi>Nervinum,</hi> and <hi>Tacamahac,</hi> of each an ounce; Balſam of <hi>Peru,</hi> two drams. Make a ſquare Plaiſter to be applied to the Loyns.</p>
                        <p>Take the expres'd Juice of ten River Crabs boyl'd in Milk, and add to it three ounces of the Crum of white Bread, three yelks of Eggs, an ounce of Butter, an ounce of the Oyl of Chamomil, and half a ſcruple of Saffron. Mix all for a Cataplaſm, to be applied to the Loyns, for allaying the exceſſive heat of the Kidneys.</p>
                        <p>While theſe Preſcriptions are in uſe, 'twill be requiſite to look out for internal Med'cines. In the beginning gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Laxatives are uſeful. They ought to be mix'd with the meekeſt Diuretics. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of Tartar Vitriolat, fifteen grains; Salt of Broom, three or four grains; Scammony prepar'd with the Juice of Roſes, three grains; diſtill'd Oyl of Turpentin, a drop. Make a Powder to be exhibited in the beginning of the Paroxyſm. Or,</p>
                        <pb n="410" facs="tcp:207638:206"/>
                        <p>Take of Turpentin, a dram; Rhubarb in Powder, two ſcruples; prepar'd Amber, half a dram; Cinnamon, half a ſcruple; with the Oyl of Turpentin make Pills for a few Doſes. Note, Turpentin is both a Laxative and a Diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retic, and upon that account highly uſeful in this caſe. The Emulſions of Violet-ſeeds with Speedwell-water mix'd with Crabs Eyes, are alſo very proper for the ſame purpoſes.</p>
                        <p>The firſt Paſſages being clear'd, we exhibit ſuch Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cins as mitigat the Pain, and allay the ſharpneſs of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, with gentle Diuretics. Thus the Elixir of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niper, mix'd with the Eſſence of Opium, and exhibited by Spoonfuls: The Oyl of ſweet Almonds mix'd with Pearch Stones, and the Syrup of Maſh-mallows: And the Emulſions temperat Seeds are very proper. In general, Narcotics are very ſerviceable, not only by allaying the Pain, but by procuring Sleep, and ſo ſtrengthening the Spirits in order to the expulſion of the Stone. To theſe we add the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and eaſie Diuretics. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of prepar'd Crabs Eyes, <hi>Sperma Ceti,</hi> of each a ſcruple; volatil Salt of Amber, five grains; <hi>Laudanum Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atum,</hi> two grains. Make a Powder. Sometimes we add Cinnabar of Antimony, for preventing or removing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion of the internal parts,</p>
                        <p>Take twelve living Wood-Lice; bruiſe 'em with two drams of the ſharpeſt Tincture of Tartar; then ſtrain it, and add a ſcruple of the Eſſence of Opium. Doſe thirty or forty drops. The Tincture of the Balſam of <hi>Peru,</hi> or that of <hi>Capivi,</hi> are likewiſe very proper.</p>
                        <p>Take of the extract of Acorus, ſixteen grains; Caſtor four grains; <hi>Hyſteric Laudanum,</hi> ſix grains; with the Oyl of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentin make Pills, to be exhibited when a Vomiting and Hic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cough attend the Stone in the Kidneys.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Water of Strawberries and Winter Cherries, of each an ounce and a half; Cinnamon-water, three drams; Crabs Eyes, two ſcruples; Egg-ſhells calcin'd, a ſcruple; purify'd Nitre, half a dram; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> two or three grains; Syrup of Marſh-mallows half an ounce. Make a Potion.</p>
                        <p>Take of prepar'd red Coral, and Pearch Stones, of each fourteen grains Diaphoretic Gold, twelve grains; Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyr, three grains. Make a Powder for two Doſes.</p>
                        <p>Take of Marſhmallows-roots, an ounce; Liquorice-roots, two drams; Mallows, one handful; Violet-ſeeds, half an
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:207638:206"/>ounce. Boyl them in Barley-water. To two pound of the ſtrain'd Decoction, add of the Syrup of Poppies, two oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; prepar'd Crab's Eyes, a dram. Mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sometimes we add Juniper-berries, Carrot-ſeeds, St. <hi>Johns</hi>-wort-ſeed, <hi>&amp;c. Foreſtus</hi>'s diuretic Decoction is much approv'd. As alſo the decoction of Chamomil-flowers, or that of Water-lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. In every draught of ſuch Decoctions, 'tis cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to add a few drops of the Spirit of Nitre, or of a mixture of the Spirit of Salt with the volatil Salt of Amber.</p>
                        <p>When the Symptoms attending the Fit begin to relent, we muſt have recourſe to ſtrong ſharp Diuretics; ſuch are, the Juice of Radiſhes, given to two ounces with Spaniſh Wine; the Roots and Leaves of Horſe-radiſhes infus'd in Wine; or a Spirit diſtill'd from Wine, in which Roots or Leaves of Horſe-Radiſhes have been infus'd in a Cellar for fourteen Days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the Eſſence of Reſtharrow; Burdock-ſeeds; the Infuſion of Ground-Ivy dry'd and Garlic Heads in the Spirit of Wine, or that of Juniper-berries; an Electuary of the Rob of Juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and St. <hi>Johns</hi>-wort-ſeeds, which when bruis'd ſmell like Turpentin, and conſequently muſt needs be ſerviceable both for cleanſing the Veins, and preſerving their ferment by its balmy virtue; Carrot-ſeeds infus'd in fermenting Ale: The diſtill'd Oyl and volatil Salt of Aſh-tree-ſeeds; or the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Oyl;</p>
                        <p>Take of the inner rindes of Aſh-tree-roots, two pound; freſh Juniper-berries, three pound; Turpentin, a pound and a half. Mix 'em with the Turpentin, and digeſt all for the ſpace of three Months in twelve pound of Water. Then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill an admirable Diuretic Oyl. Doſe, eight or ten drops in white Wine.</p>
                        <p>The Juice of the tendrels of the Birch-tree gather'd in <hi>March</hi> is of excellent uſe, if drank like Spaw-waters. As al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Water diſtill'd from Arſmart and frequently coho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated; the Decoctions of the <hi>Indian</hi> Nephritic Wood; the Gum of the Cherry-tree form'd into Pills, or diſſolv'd in Wine; and the Nephritic Eſſences or Spirits of Winter Cherries, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niper-berries, <hi>&amp;c. Timaeus</hi> recommends the Juice of the wild Tanſey gather'd in <hi>May</hi> before the Sun-riſing; and that of green Rye, mixt with red Wine. To theſe we add the volatil Salt of Amber, the Salt of Urine, Nitre, Spirit of Nitre, and all nitrous Salts, eſpecially that of Pigeons Dung;
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:207638:207"/>or the infuſion of Pigeons Dung in Vinegar, mix'd with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; or the following Salt;</p>
                        <p>Take Nitre well fix'd, and expoſe it to the Air. 'Twill melt to the conſiſtence of Pap. Then mix it with an equal quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the red Oyl of Vitriol. When their Ebullition ceaſes, draw off the Liquor with a ſtrong Fire, and 'twill leave a white Salt, of admirable efficacy againſt the Stone.</p>
                        <p>The Mineral and Animal Stones are likewiſe recommended in this caſe, eſpecially Nephritic Stones, Crabs Eyes, Pearch or Carp Stones, the ſhells of Eggs, eſpecially Eſtrich Eggs. They are not directly Diuretic, but they drink up the Acid that gathers the Stone, and if diſſolv'd in the compound Spirit of Salt are converted into a third Concrete that proves an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Diuretic. The Lye of the calcin'd Eggſhells, the lixivious Salt of Quick-lime calcin'd with <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> are alſo much approv'd. The decoction of Quick-lime in Water being ſtrain'd and congeal'd, yields a fix'd Salt, which is either us'd in Powder, or infus'd in rectify'd Spirits, to which it gives a notable red Tincture that's much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. <hi>Helvetius</hi> boyl'd Quick-lime in Vinegar, and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated the decanted Decoction. The remaining Salt he made red hot in a Crucible, and extracted a notable nephritic Tincture with Spirit of Wine. The Spirit of putrify'd Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms is alſo a proper Diuretic; or the Powder of Scorpions, firſt waſh'd, then infus'd alive in Spaniſh Wine for 24 Hours, and then bak'd in an Oven in a Pot cover'd with Sage leaves; their Doſe is four or five grains in a potch'd Egg. If the Wings, Head, and Feet of Crickets be lop'd off, and its Body be macerated in Parſley-water, 'twill become a milky Liquor that's very Diuretic. The Eſſence of Wrens is much applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as likewiſe the following Pills.</p>
                        <p>Take black Beetles gather'd in <hi>May,</hi> without touching 'em with one's Hand. Suffocat 'em in Spirit of Wine, then dry 'em, cut 'em into pieces; and in the middle of their Body ye will find a viſcous Liquor, which mix with their Powder, to the conſiſtence of a Balſam. Then take of this Balſam, adram; diſtill'd Oyl of Anis and that of Cloves, of each three drops. Make Pills. Of which exhibit two grains once or twice in Elder-flower water, in the Morning with a faſting Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac. They will cauſe a Strangury that ſhall laſt for thirty Days.</p>
                        <p>If Diuretic Med'cines prove ineffectual, we ought to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continue their uſe for ſome time, leſt the Kidneys be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercharg'd
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:207638:207"/>with Crudities. The ſtrongeſt of theſe Diure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks are by ſome call'd <hi>Lithontriptica,</hi> or diſſolvers of the Stone in the Body; but I doubt much if any ſuch Med'cines be yet diſcover'd. 'Tis certain that Spirit of Nitre will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve a Stone out of the Body; but the alteration it undergoes in mixing with the various Humours in the Body cramp its virtue within us. And therefore whoever pretends to the knowledge of <hi>Lithontriptica</hi>'s muſt have found out ſuch a Med'cine as is not liable to be chang'd by the Humours of the Body, and beſides, that is neither an Acid nor an Alcali, but conſiſts of both as the Stone it ſelf, and is peculiarly calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for its Pores, as <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> is for Silver. Some have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded all <hi>Lithontriptica</hi>'s, as being too corroſive and apt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the Stomac, Guts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But they ought to conſider that all ſharp diſſolving <hi>Menſtruum</hi>'s are not corroſive to the taſte, as Arſenic, Quick-ſilver, <hi>Mercurius Vitae,</hi> &amp;c. whic are altogether inſipid. And beſides, ſome Liquors are qualify'd for diſſolving hard Concretes, that wo'not pick upon ſofter Objects; as Vinegar diſſolves the ſhells of Eggs, while their inner Membran is left intire.</p>
                        <p>After the Paroxyſm is over and the Stone voided, we ought to prevent the generation of new ones by proper pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatives; as 1. By keeping the firſt Paſſages clean with Laxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and once in three or four Months a Vomit, or a ſtronger Purge. 2. By correcting the Acid in the firſt Paſſages with abſorbent Powders, and the fix'd Salts of Diuretic Plants. 3. By cleanſing the Reins and evacuating the firſt Rudiments of the Stone, with volatil Diuretics, the Spirit and volitil Salt of Tartar, the Spirit of Urine, that of <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> the Spirit of Worms, <hi>Elixir Proprietatis,</hi> Turpentin, fat Broth, Whey, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some commend Milk, but its Curd diſſwades us from uſing it. However we ought ſtill to remember that the Diuretics muſt be of the meeker ſort, and exhibited only once or twice in a Fortnight or three Weeks, and that at ſome diſtance from the times of eating, but not till the firſt Paſſages are clear'd. 4. By ſtrengthening the Reins, retrieving their ferment, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Urine from corruption, with balmy Med'cines, ſuch as Turpentin, the Balſam of Sulphur, Juniper, St. <hi>John's-wort</hi>-ſeeds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>A Diabetes</hi> is either genuin or ſpurious. The former is a void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Liquors by Urine without any ſtay or alteration in the Body. The latter is a voiding of a much larger quantity of Urine than that of Liquids receiv'd into the Body. The cauſe of the former is the laxity and openneſs of the Paſſages which lead directly from the firſt Paſſages to the Reins. 'Tis true theſe Paſſages are not yet diſcover'd, but the quick Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of ſome Liquors, and their being voided without any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in colour, taſte, or conſiſtence, according to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of <hi>Galen, Bartholin, Hildanus,</hi> &amp;c. do ſufficiently evince their neceſſity. The cauſe of the latter is a ſharp vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil Salt or Ferment bred in the firſt Paſſages, that diſſolves the fat acid in the Blood, Chyle, and muſcular Fleſh, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locking their Texture, and melting the ferment of the Reins. Thus the balmy and nutritious parts of the Blood being melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down, and tinctur'd with a ſharp acrimony, they ſtimulat the Kidneys, and force their paſſage. This volatil Alcali Salt is not unlike that which ſometimes cauſes melting looſeneſſes, or that of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Flies and Beetles, and is frequently the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower of violent Diureticks. Perhaps it alſo ſucks in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity of the Air in the Body, by virtue of which it melts, and ſo increaſes the quantity of Urine, which ſometimes exceeds that of all the Juices in the Body. The Symptoms of the ſpurious <hi>Diabetes</hi> are the crudity, thinneſs, and ſweet taſte of the Urine, with a fat Scum ſwimming upon it; a notable weakneſs, leanneſs, dryneſs of the Mouth, thirſt, a heat and pain in the Loyns, a ſlow Feaver, and in ſhort, all the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of a Hectic. If it follow immoderat Labour, Venery, or Chronical Feavers, 'tis uncurable.</p>
                        <p>For Cure of a genuin <hi>Diabetes</hi> we exhibit Aſtringents and Aromatics, ſuch as we generally preſcribe for defending and fortifying the Stomac and Bowels in the uſe of Spaw Waters. Thus the aſtringent crocus of Steel, the Tincture of the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur of Vitriol, Bole Armenic, ſeal'd Earth, Conſerve of Roſes vitriolated, the decoction of Orange-peel, and Plantan bol'd in Chalybeat-water, are very proper. Some recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:207638:208"/>as an <hi>Arcanum,</hi> a Cocks-comb calcin'd, and exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ones own Urine. As for the Cure of a ſpurious <hi>Diabetes;</hi> we muſt endeavour to correct the Acrimony of the Volatil Alcali; to prevent the colliquation of the Juices by Narcotics, and proper Aſtringents. Firſt of all, their Diet muſt be the ſame as that of Hectic Perſons. In the next place vomiting is very proper; to which we ſubjoin the Powder of the natural Blood-ſtone, or of the Artificial one, made of the Vitriol of Steel, and Sugar of Lead. The Antiphthiſical Tincture prepar'd from the ſame Ingredients. The Tincture of the Sulphur of Vitriol; the aſtringent Crocus of Steel, the Powder or Spirit of Allum, Amber, and its Troches, or thoſe of ſeal'd Earth, taken in an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid Vehicle; the Tincture or Magiſtery of Coral, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with the Juice of Citrons, or their mixture with Vinegar.</p>
                        <p>Take of Plantan Water, three ounces; Diſtill'd Vinegar, ſix drams; red Coral pulveriz'd, (not prepar'd) a dram; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> two grains; Syrup of Purſlain, an ounce. Mix, and exhibit a ſpoonful frequently.</p>
                        <p>Quicklime-Water, given to four or five ounces thrice a day, is of ſingular uſe in this Diſtemper; as alſo Milk, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Chalybeat Milk, or that in which hot Irons are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extinguiſh'd; Aſſes or Goats Milk are the Beſt, and next to them Cows Milk. The Emulſions of ſweet Almonds, and white Poppy-ſeeds are alſo very proper. Externally ſome apply to the Kidneys, the Juice of River-Crabbs, or Baggs of Plantan and Oak-Leaves boil'd in Chalybeat Milk.</p>

                        <head>ART. 4. <hi>Of a Piſſing of Blood.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THE Urine is ſometimes tinctur'd with Blood, and that more or leſs according to its quantity. The Blood ſprings either from the Kidney, Ureters, or Yard; or from the Contuſions of other parts. The Cauſes are the ſame as thoſe of all Bleedings, <hi>viz.</hi> Either an <hi>Anaſtomoſis</hi> or <hi>Diaere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis:</hi> The former is caus'd by the laxity of the Pores of the Reins, violent Motion, Jumping, Falls, exceſſive Venery, violent Diuretics, and a redundancy of Blood in the Body. The latter by ſharp corroſive Humors, as in maligant Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, the Small Pox, and the Scurvy, or by the application of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Flies without mixing and tempering them with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids, by the Stone, Ulcers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The bloody Urine is diſtinguiſh'd from that which is only tinctur'd by Salts, by its thick intranſparent Conſiſtence, and a red blackiſh Sediment, like clotted Blood at the bottom of the Urinal. When the Blood proceeds from the Kidneys, or Bladder, a heavy or gnawing pain beſets thoſe parts. When the Blood is plentiful and well mix'd with the Urine, and is not curdled, but liquid when it falls to the bottom, it comes from the Kidneys. When the Blood is ſcarce, unequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mix'd, voided with Pain, and gives a clotty Sediment, it takes its riſe from the Bladder. If the Blood be voided without the Urine, or fall to the Bottom immediately upon making of Water, it proceeds only from the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra.</hi> If a ſharp Urine be voided with a ſharp gnawing biting Pain, and if a ſtrangury or difficulty of making Water went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the flux of blood is caus'd by the Corroſion of the Veſſels. If it proceed from <hi>Cantharides,</hi> the Perſon is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted with an eternal erection of the Yard. If it proceed from the corroſion or ulceration of the Bladder, 'tis very dangerous; but that from the corroſion or weakneſs of the Reins, is yet more ſuch.</p>
                        <p>For Cure, the Cauſes muſt be enquir'd after, and remov'd after the ſame method, as in ſpitting of Blood. A redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy of blood admits of bleeding. The ſharpneſs of the Serum prohibits both that and Purgation. Rhubarb indeed
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:207638:209"/>may be allow'd, as being an Alterative and Fortifyer of the Reins, as well as a Laxative. <hi>Sylvius</hi>'s Mixture of Coral, Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons-blood, <hi>Laudanum,</hi> and Syrup of Myrtles with Vinegar, and Plantan and Cinnamon-water, is a general preſcription for all <hi>Haemorrhagia</hi>'s. However, the Acrimony of the Urine ought always to be accounted for by the Juice of Plantan, or Purſlain, or the Syrup of the Juice of Comfrey and that of Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Leaves; the Decoction of Ground-Ivy; or the following Decoction.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Herbs Agrimony and Yarrow, the tops of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Wort, and the Moſs of Bullace-Trees, of each a handful; Comfrey-Roots, two ounces; St <hi>John</hi>'s-wort-Seeds, two, three, or four drams; boil 'em in Chalybeat Milk, or Whey, or Black-Smith's Water; ſweeten the ſtrain'd Decoction with the Syrup of Comfrey, and add to every Draught, Crabs Eyes diſſolv'd in Vinegar.</p>
                        <p>The Decoction of Ground-Ivy, or Ground-Pine; Sheep's Milk exhibited to four ounces, with a dram of Bole-Armenic; Amber, and eſpecially its Troches, given to a dram, with half a dram of Bole-Armenic, and a little Vinegar in Plantan-water, or with Crabbs Eyes, and Sugar of Lead; the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Sulphur of Vitriol, the Antiphthiſical Tincture; prepar'd Blood-ſtone exhibited with Milk, (eſpecially when the Diſeaſe is caus'd by <hi>Cantharides</hi>) and the Emulſions of milky Seeds, are all very proper; and ought to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently interlac'd with <hi>Laudanum Opiatum.</hi> To theſe we add vulnerary Ingredients, eſpecially the Juice or Powder of River-Crabbs, and Turpentin, either given in Pills with Rhubarb, or diſſolv'd with the Yelk of an Egg, in ſome convenient Vehicle. The Spirit and Oyl of Turpentin are too ſharp. If the Bladder be ulcerated we may inject the Troches of Amber mix'd with Plantan Water, or the Juice of Plantan with the Powder of Blood-ſtone. When the Piſſing of blood is over, we ought to diſſolve the clotty Blood that may remain in the Bladder, with Amber and its Productions.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>THE Urine being ſeparated in the Kidneys, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd through the Ureters to the Bladder; and when its diſtending quantity, or its ſharpneſs provokes the Bladder to Contractions, is voided thro' the <hi>

                        <p>This natural Evacuation is ſuppreſs'd either thro' the default of the Bladder, or of its <hi>Sphincter,</hi> or of the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thra.</hi> The Bladder is faulty when its Fibres are heedleſs and ſtupid, as in Malignant Feavers; or relaxated, and unable to contract it. This may be occaſion'd by ſtaying long in cold Water, by Wounds, Blows, Bruiſes in the lower part of the Back, or any Injury done to the Nerves of the Part; by an exceſſive quantity of Urine forcibly retain'd in the Bladder, by Worms, Ulcers, Inflammations, Tumors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Bladder and adjacent parts; and by the remiſsneſs of the Muſcles of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> which ought naturally to preſs its Fibres. The <hi>Sphincter</hi> is faulty when it ſhuts the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as being conſtantly contracted. 'Tis provok'd to ſuch Contractions by Cholic and Nephritic Pains, Scorbutical Pains in the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and the Application of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Flies. The <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra</hi> or Paſſage which leads from the Bladder is faulty, when Inflammations, Tumors, or Venereal Excreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences beſet the Neck of the Bladder, <hi>Proſtratae</hi> or <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum;</hi>
                           <pb n="419" facs="tcp:207638:210"/>or when 'tis block'd up by a Stone, clotty Blood, or viſcous glutinous Humours occaſion'd by uſing Diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics immediately after eating before the Chyle be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, or by giving bad Milk to New-born Children, who are naturally liable to that Symptom.</p>
                        <p>The Symptoms of this Diſtemper are theſe. When the Bladder is over-diſtended by a large quantity of Urine, the Perſon is moleſted with a grievous pain, and vain deſire of making Water, and the ſuppreſſion is difficult to cure; when the Bladder is Paralytic, 'tis inſenſible of Pain, or of any Provocation to evacuat; when the urinary Paſſage is obſtructed, a painful Tumor appears in the Pubes, and is exaſperated by touching. If clotty Blood cauſe the Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, 'tis diſcover'd by preceding Falls, Bruiſes, piſſing of Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If glutinous Humors block up the Way, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent Cauſes, and Slime voided with the Urine, will give us to know it. If a ſuppreſſion of Urine in the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be free of all Pain, and attended by a <hi>Teneſmus,</hi> and Hiccough, it prognoſticates Death. That from a Schirrus in the Neck of the Bladder, or adjacent parts, is not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cur'd.</p>
                        <p>The Cure is vary'd according to the Cauſes. If the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be Paralytic, and inſenſible, we give inwardly Cepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Medicines, eſpecially the Elixyr and diſtill'd Oyls of Juniper; the diſtill'd Oyl of Amber, or that of Turpentin, the Brains of Magpies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and inject Clyſters, firſt of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mollient Ingredients, and afterward of Centory, Coloquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or we adminiſter gentle Purgatives, and order the Perſon to keep in his Breath, and ſqueeze the <hi>Abdomen.</hi> If theſe methods be ineffectual, we open the Paſſage with a Catheter, or rather a Wax Candle, anointed with Hony and Oyl of ſweet Almonds. When the Bladder is empty'd, we inject the Decoction of Sage, Penny-royal, wild Marjoram, Calamint, Rue, Caſtor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in Wine; and foment the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Parts with a Spunge, or apply Cataplaſms of Pellitory, and Oyl of Scorpions; or anoint the <hi>Pubes</hi> and <hi>Perinaeum</hi> with a Liniment of the Oyntment of Marſhmallows, Oyl of Scorpions, and diſtill'd Oyl of Juniper, applying afterwards to the <hi>Os ſacrum</hi> and <hi>Pubes</hi> the Plaiſter call'd <hi>Nervinum,</hi> ſoften'd with the Oyl of Amber. If the ſuppreſſion be very obſtinate, we order bathing in the Decoctions of emollient and nervous Plants, exhibiting at the ſame time ſome gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Diuretic. In Malignant Feavers, we apply the ſame
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:207638:211"/>Ointments and Decoctions, and order the Patient to walk up and down the Room. When the Bladder is diſtended, we uſe the ſame Method. When the <hi>Sphincter</hi> is contracted, we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit inwardly the Specifics for Convulſions, mix'd with O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piats; and anoint with a Liniment of the Ointment of Marſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallows, mix'd with the Oyls of Poppies, Caſtor, and Amber.</p>
                        <p>If the Paſſage be ſtopp'd by clotted Blood, we exhibit Crabbs Eyes with Vinegar, the Decoctions of Chervil, <hi>Sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma ceti, &amp;c.</hi> and foment or bath with the Decoctions of Antipleuritical Ingredients; applying likewiſe Cataplaſms of freſh Cows Dung. If viſcid Humors block up the Paſſage, we give firſt a gentle Purge; then the Juice of Limons with Spirit of Turpentin, or Spirit of Salt; the Juice of Radiſhes, and Decoctions of aperient and diuretic Ingredients, to which Black Garden-Currants are added. If the <hi>Proſtatae</hi> be ſwoll'n, we apply Cataplaſms of Brook-lime, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momil Flowers. If purulent Matter ſtick in the way, we exhibit the Oyl of Amber, and that of Juniper, and clear the Paſſage with a Cacheter, providing the Bladder be not inflam'd. If Excreſcences beſet the <hi>

                        <p>For all Suppreſſions of Urine in general, we foment the Parts with the Decoction of Pellitory, Anis and Parſley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeds, Zedoary and Bay-berries in Wine; and apply Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſms of Pellitory (growing upon the Rubbiſh of Old-Walls) with roaſted Onyons, Garlick, Oyl of Scorpions, and Oyl of Juniper; or anoint with the ſame Oyls mix'd with Rock-Oyl.</p>

                        <head>ART. 2. <hi>Of the Stone in the Bladder.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THE Stone of the Bladder is for the moſt part, firſt bred in the Reins, and introduc'd by Nephritic Pains, and, when it deſcends through the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>reters</hi> into the Bladder, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a conſiderable increaſe from the Mucilage, or deprav'd nutritious Juice, that ſticks to it, and becomes hard as it ſelf. Thus we find that ſtones in the Bladder are cover'd like an <hi>Onyon</hi> with ſeveral diſtinct Coats, and have a Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel in the middle, which repreſents the Stone as it came from the Kidneys. The Symptoms are; a ſudden ſtopping of Urine in the very time of making it, follow'd by a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and vain Deſire of finiſhing that Evacuation, and of going to ſtool; a dull ſenſe of weight about the <hi>Perinaeum</hi> and <hi>Pubes;</hi> a Pain, and itching in the Nut of the Yard, and its perpetual Erection, occaſion'd by the irritation of the inner Membrane: When the Perſon ſtoops to pull up any thing from the ground, he feels a pricking and pain about the <hi>Pubes;</hi> when he jumps, he feels it move, unleſs it be grown to the Membrane, as when the Bladder is tore; in which caſe it muſt be ſearch'd with a Cacheter. When the <hi>Evil</hi> is inveterat, the nutritious Juice of the injur'd Parts is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd, and voided in the form of a Mucilage like white Clay, which ſome are apt to take for the Matter of which the Stone is bred, whereas 'tis properly its effect. The Stone in Women is more eaſily cur'd than in Men, whoſe Bladder is more inacceſſible. If it be inclos'd in a peculiar Membrane, 'tis ſcarce curable.</p>
                        <p>The Internal Cure is the ſame as that of a Stone in the Kidneys, to which we refer the Reader. The Blood and Urine of a Goat, and the Juice of Wood-lice bruis'd with the Spirit of Juniper-Berries, or Tincture of Tartar, are particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended; as alſo Pills of the Salts of Ivy-Berries and Water-Creſſes mix'd with the Cryſtals of Nitre and Tartar, and with Turpentin. If the Stone be in motion,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:207638:212"/>and be not very large, we may give a Vomit to drive it out. Externally we inject proper Liquors for diſſolving the Stone; for which purpoſe ſome commend the warm Blood of a Goat or Fox; or the ſolution of calcin'd Pigeons Dung in Pellitory Water. We likewiſe order Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations and Bathing in proper Decoctions; and anoint the <hi>Pubes</hi> and <hi>Perinaeum,</hi> with a Liniment of Rock-oyl, and the expreſs'd Oyls of Poppies and Henbane; or apply a Cataplaſm of white Onyons boil'd in Wine, and mix'd with the Oyl of Scorpions. As for Clyſters, their Virtue is ſufficiently known. When all proves ineffectual, the Stone muſt be cut, and if the Inflammation and Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene of the Bladder can be prevented, there's no great danger in the operation.</p>

                        <p n="3">3. The cutting or tearing of its Fibres, eſpecially in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Stone, or in time of Delivery, when the Midwives ſcratch the <hi>Caruncula Myrtiformis</hi> with their Nails.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes the efflux of Urine cannot be properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led involuntary; but 'tis ſuch, that the Perſon is frequently oblig'd to make Water, and cannot retain the Urine ſo long as naturally one may. The immediat Cauſe is the perpetual Irritation of the Bladder, occaſion'd by rough Stones, or ſharp Humours; or the Compreſſion of the Bladder, caus'd by the
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:207638:212"/>diſtended Womb in Women with Child, or by exceſſive Laughing and Coughing, eſpecially in fat Perſons; or by Inflammations of the Muſcles of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> and adjacent Parts. Some Perſons are liable to an involuntary voiding of Urine when they're aſleep, eſpecially Children and Old Perſons, whoſe Spirits are lazy and inactive.</p>
                        <p>An incontinence of Urine, proceeding from a Palſy, or from the default of the Brain, or ſpinal Marrow, is very difficult to cure. In Old Perſons, or when it follows Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, 'tis ſeldom cur'd. In Feavers, 'tis a fatal Sign. In Children 'tis overcome by Nature before the Twenty Fifth Year of age; or elſe accompanies 'em to the Grave.</p>
                        <p>The Cure in general is perform'd by Aſtringents, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Decoction of Calamint, Agrimony, and Mint in Wine; the Powders of Galangal, Aloes-Wood, Acorus, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, Myrrh, Frankincenſe, Gum Arabic, and Maſtic. The moſt noted Specifics are the Throat of a Cock roaſted, pounded, and given to a dram in Wine; the Powder of a burnt or calcin'd Hedge-hog; the Powder call'd <hi>Medulla Saxorum;</hi> The inner Tunicle of a Hen's Ventricle, which when dry'd, becomes hard like Horn; the Fiſh found in the Belly of a Pike; the Powder of a Sow's Womb; or for Men, of a Boar's <hi>Pudendum;</hi> the Powder of Hogg's Hoofs; the Powder of dry'd Mice; and the Dung of a She-Goat. Externally we order Fomentations, and Baths, of the Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Aſtringent nervous Plants, ſuch as Mint, Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Pomgranat Flowers, Tormentil Roots, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Comfrey-Roots, in Blackſmith's Water. For Old Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, there's nothing ſo proper as the Natural Hot-Baths. After Fomentation or Bathing, 'tis convenient to anoint the Loins and Pubes with the Oils of Mint, Amber, Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Maſtic, Balſam of <hi>Peru,</hi> diſtill'd Oyl of Juniper, Turpentin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to apply the Plaiſter <hi>Oxycroceum</hi> ſoften'd with Oyl of Amber. After hard Labour in Child-birth, ſome recommend an Ointment of Calaminar ſtone, waſh'd in Vinegar and Roſe-water, and pulveriz'd with Litharge of Silver, Ceruſs, Oyl of Roſes, Oyl of Chamomil, and Goat's Fat. Finally, the Powder of a Toad, taken alive and burnt in a New Pot, being hung in a Bag about the Neck, is univerſally approv'd of for curing any incontinency of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine.</p>

                        <head>ART. 4. <hi>Of a Strangury.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>A Strangury is a making of Water by drops, with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable Pain in the Neck of the Bladder, and <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thra,</hi> and a violent Itch for piſſing and going to ſtool. The Cauſe is the acidity and ſharpneſs of the Urine, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes the Bladder to Contraction, and when the <hi>Sphincter</hi> opens to give it vent, provokes it likewiſe to ſhut the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. Thus the reciprocal Contractions of the Bladder and <hi>Sphincter,</hi> occaſion the voiding of Urine by drops; and the ſharpneſs of the Humour cauſes the exceſſive Pain, which is more violent in the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra</hi> than the Bladder, by reaſon that the one is defended by a ſlimy Matter, and the other is not. The Remote Cauſe of the acidity of the Humors, is an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect digeſtion in the firſt Paſſages, and the inactivity of the Bile. Thus New Wine or Ale will cauſe a Strangury, as being apt to turn Acid in the Stomach. The Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gury which attends the Venereal Diſeaſe, proceeds from a ſharp corroſive Lymph, voided by the <hi>Proſtatae.</hi> If a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gury continue long, 'tis apt to create Ulcers in the Bladder; nay, ſometimes it may proceed from Excoriations or Ulcers of the Bladder. In Old Perſons, whoſe digeſting Faculty is weak, 'tis almoſt incurable.</p>
                        <p>The Cure conſiſts in tempering the ſharpneſs of the Humors, and rectifying the ſtate of the Bladder. The latter Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is accounted for above. The Firſt is anſwer'd by Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, as being wonderfully uſeful in all Diſeaſes relating to the Urine. Purges of Rhubarb, or Jalap and Turpentin, are alſo very proper. When the firſt Paſſages are clear'd, the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or rather the diſtill'd Oyl of Orange-Peel, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable efficacy for deſtroying the Acid, and whetting the Bile. In general we recommend for a Strangury, the Decoction of Black Currants and Carret-ſeed in red Wine; the Decoction of Winter Cherres, with Raiſins; the Decoction of Rapes; the Emulſions of Hemp-ſeed and the four cold Seeds; the Oyl of ſweet Almonds mix'd with the Syrup of Marſhmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows and Crabbs Eyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Juice of River-Crabbs; the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Onyons in ſome proper Vehicle; the dulcify'd Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:207638:213"/>of Nitre; the carminative Spirit <hi>de tribus;</hi> the Spirit of Tartar; the Spirit of Wine taken every Night going to Bed; the Balſam of Sulphur; Oyl of Amber; Troches of Amber; and above all, the Balſam <hi>Capivi</hi> given in Parſley-Water, and Borace given to a ſcruple. A Strangury caus'd by new Ale, is cur'd by the Powder of Nutmegs. If theſe Medicines prove ineffectual, we muſt have recourſe to Aromatic Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, ſuch as <hi>Galangal,</hi> Zedoary, Orange Peel, Elixyr of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niper Berries, and eſpecially Wine in which burning Flint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones are extinguiſh'd.</p>
                        <p>Externally, anoint the Navel (which communicats with the Bladder by the Urachus) with a mixture of Goats Tallow, and the diſtill'd Oyls of Wax and Orange Peel; or ſumigat the Parts with the Decoction of Radiſhes in Wine. Inject Chalybeat Milk, or Oyl of ſweets Almonds, into the Bladder; and in time of Piſſing let the Yard be put into warm Milk. Anodyn Emellient Clyſters are alſo proper; as likewiſe Emollient Fomentations and Baths. For old Perſons there's nothing ſo ſerviceable as the natural Hot Baths.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>A <hi>Dyſuria</hi> is a voiding of Urine with a great deal of Pain and Heat. It differs from a Strangury in this, that the Urine is not voided by Drops, but in a due quantity; that the Pain vaniſhes after making Water; that it cauſes no vain deſire of Piſſing, or going to Stool, and that its Pain is accompany'd with a burning Heat. The cauſe for the moſt part is the Inflammation, Corroſion, or Ulceration of the Neck of the Bladder, Urethra or adjacent Parts. Thus the Stone ſometimes galls the parts as it paſſes, and cauſes a Heat of Urine. The Inflammation of the <hi>Proſtatae,</hi> or the ſharp Corroſive Humor voided by 'em; the Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Womb, <hi>Inteſtinum Rectum,</hi> or the Emrods, will produce the ſame effect. Sometimes, but very rarely, it proceeds from the ſharpneſs of Urine, as being laden with Scorbutical Salts, or mix'd with ſome purulent Matter, or impregnated with Cantharides, or corroſive Preparations of Mercury. When the Bladder and adjacent Parts are thus
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:207638:214"/>diſorder'd, their nutritive Juice is deprav'd, and voided with the Urine, in the form of a thick milky Mucilage; in which caſe the Diſeaſe is dangerous. If this Diſtemper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long, it degenerats into an Ulcer of the Badder, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continence of Urine.</p>
                        <p>The Cure conſiſts in tempering the ſharpneſs of Urine, and rectifying the ſtate of the Bladder and adjacent Parts. For which Purpoſes the ſame Medicines as were recommended for a Strangury are proper; to which we may add the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of Mallows Flowers the Decoction of Sebeſten with Houſe-leek Water, Whey, or Milk in which Blew-bottle or Larks-heel Flowers are boyl'd (eſpecially when the Diſeaſe is occaſion'd by Cantharides;) Turpentin mix'd with Amber, Frankincenſe, Myrrh, and the Juice of Liquorice; the Bladder a Goat in Powder, with the diſtill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <head>ART. I. <hi>Of Catarrhs.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>A Catarrh is a preternatural Defluxion of Lymph from the Conglamerated Glandules, into ſome noted Cavity of the Body, eſpecially the Throat, Breaſt, and Head, where theſe Glandules are very plentiful, and their Lymph is moſt liable to alterations from the Air. A Catarrh therefore proceeds from the Conſtriction of the Fibres of the Glandules, occaſion'd by ſome provoking Cauſes. Theſe Cauſes are either External or Internal. The former are the malignity of the Air (in Epidemical Catarrhs) ſharp Steams, and external Cold contracting the Fibres, hindring a free Tranſpiration, and ſo occaſioning the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundancy, ſtagnation, and provoking ſharpneſs of the Lymph. The internal Cauſes are the ſharpneſs or Acrimony of the Blood, and conſequently the Lymph, occaſion'd by an imperfect Digeſtion in the Stomac, Scorbutical Salts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or the occaſional Corruption of the Peculiar Nutritious Juice of the Glandules, which being deprav'd, ſticks to their ſides, and provokes 'em to Contractions. This dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy of their Juice ariſes from external injuries; or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever internal Cauſe is apt to weaken or exhauſt their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Spirit.</p>
                     <p>When the Fibres or innate Spirits of the Part are weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd, the Catarrh is <hi>Habitual</hi> and apt to relapſe; in other Caſes 'tis only <hi>Accidental,</hi> and generally take its riſe from external Occaſions. When a Catarrh begins, 'tis <hi>Thin</hi> and <hi>Sharp,</hi> as being the pure Lymph without mixture; but afterwards by its continued Flux it depraves the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritive Juice of the Glandules, which mixes with it and renders it <hi>Thick</hi> and <hi>Temperat.</hi> When the Lymph is very Coroſive and Sharp, 'tis uſually call'd a <hi>Hot</hi> Rheum; when 'tis Thick and Slimy, 'tis entitled <hi>Cold.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is yet a Spurious ſort of Catarrh, near ally'd to this above-mention'd, <hi>viz.</hi> The Stagnation of the ſerous part of the Blood in any parts, either before or after its converſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:207638:215"/>Lymph, as when Nocturnal Cold, or the Diminution of the ordinary tranſpiration cauſes pain in the Limbs. This is not properly a <hi>Catarrh,</hi> but a ſtagnation of Serum or Lymph, caus'd by the Conſtriction of the Fibres of the part in which 'tis lodg'd. Thus the Tooth-ach, Scorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic pains in the Limbs, Baſtard Pleuriſies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are of the ſame kind. The Cauſes from which they take their riſe are much the ſame as thoſe of the Genuin Catarrh. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the true Catarrh cauſes Feavers, which are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly accounted for in the Section of Feavers.</p>
                     <p>An imminent Catarrh is uſher'd in by a wearineſs of the Joynts, heavineſs of the Head, dullneſs of the Senſes, and Froth making a circle in the Urine. If the Lymph be thin and ſharp, 'tis moſtly voided in the Night time, and a ſlow Feaver increaſing towards the Evening accompanies it; if it be thick and ſlimy 'tis equally troubleſom at all times, but the Symptoms are more remiſs. If a Catarrh recur frequently in the ſame part, or if the part be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenc'd by the alterations of the Weather, 'tis a ſign that the nutritive Juice of the Glandule is deprav'd, and its innate Spirit weaken'd. If it be caus'd by the Crudites, or imperfect Digeſtion of the Stomac, it diſtinguiſhes it ſelf by frequent relapſes either in the ſame or different parts; by the Perſon's propenſity to ſpit and ſweat much; and the thinneſs and paleneſs of the Urine. Catarrhs in the Breaſt or Wind-pipe are apt to cauſe a Cough or Phthiſic. In old Perſons they're ſcarce curable, by reaſon of the weakneſs of their Digeſtive faculty, the natural Laxity of their Glandules, flatneſs of their Spirits, and Acrimony of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum. A Catarrh in the Glandules of the Brain is apt to cauſe Palſies, Lethargies, and ſuch like diſorders of the Spirits. That from the Noſe and Mouth is leaſt dangerous, eſpecially if the Matter come quickly to Concoction.</p>
                     <p>As to the Cure, let the following Cautions be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The beſt Evacuaters are Diuretics and volatil Sudori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fics. When the Stomac is faulty, Vomits and Purges are proper, but not in other Caſes.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Chronical or Habitual Catarrhs, proceeding from the Acrimony of the Serum, as in old and Scorbutical Perſons, are influenc'd by the Moon, and therefore Preſervatives ought always to exhibited before the new Moon.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="430" facs="tcp:207638:216"/>3. Opiats are of excellent uſe, eſpecially in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a Catarrh ariſing from external Cauſes. They ought always to be mix'd with volatil Salts, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Specifics. Towards the height of the Diſeaſe, or in epidemical and critical Catarrhs they muſt be cautiouſly us'd.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Iſſues and Bliſtering Plaiſters, are of uſe for drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lymph, or relieving a particular part; but they cannot remove its Cauſe. Therefore in ſcorbutical Caſes, or when the Evil is inveterat, and ſcarce curable <hi>à Priori,</hi> we muſt inſiſt on ſuch a palliative Cure, being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected thereto by nature, which frequently throws out the Lymph by Ulcers in the Legs.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Bleeding is not proper. But in ſome particular Caſes, as when the Body is very Plethoric, or Blood ſuppreſs'd in the Body, or when the Catarrh falls upon a noble part, 'tis allowable.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Cautions being premis'd, let's now Conſider the Indications. As,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Activity of the Cauſe, and ſenſe of the Part ought to be impair'd by Opiats.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The quantity of the Lymph muſt be leſſen'd, its vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous quality corrected, and the ſolid part cleans'd by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil Sudorifics.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The Stomac muſt be ſtrengthen'd, its due digeſtion retriev'd, and the ſolid part fortify'd by balmy Aromatics.</p>
                     <p>The ſpecifics proper for theſe purpoſes are Mother of Thyme, Roſe-mary, Avens-roots, Juniper-berries, and all Aromatics; Saſſafras, eſpecially its Tincture, prepar'd with the ſpirit of wild Thyme; Amber and all it preductions, eſpecially the ſuccinated ſpirit of Harts-horn; Myrrh, Sulphur or its Flowers, Maſtic-wood, and <hi>Sperma Ceti.</hi> From ſuch Ingredients we make ſeveral Preſcriptions, ſuch as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions of Woods; the infuſion of Aromatic and Stoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical Herbs in Wine, an Electuary of the Rob of Juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-berries mix'd with Spices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Cure of ſharp and thick Humors vary's, as that of dry and wet Coughs. In ſcorbutical Caſes we always add ſome preparation from the Pine-tree. When we exhibit Purgatives we mix 'em with the Specifics, as in <hi>Crato</hi>'s Pills of Amber, Jalap, ſweet Mercury, and, in inveterat Caſes, Hellebor, are recommended. If the Humor be thick, <hi>Coliquintida</hi> corrected with ſalt of Tartar, or <hi>Ferra foliata Tartari,</hi> will be very proper. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally in Catarrhs of the Head, we apply to the Crown of the Head and Temples the Oyl of Amber, diſtill'd Oyl
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:207638:216"/>of Mace, or of Harts-horn, if the Perſon be not offended by the ſmell; and the Plaiſter of Betony mix'd with Tacamahac, and ſoften'd with the Oyl of Amber. In Catarrhs of the Breaſt, we fumigat the Mouth and Face with Amber, Maſtic, Benzoin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But above all, the ſmoak of Tobacco is of admirable uſe, if it be mix'd with the Powder of Amber, Anis, or Coriander Seeds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſpurious Catarrhs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mention'd are cur'd internally with Sudorifics and urinous Spirits. Externally by applying the Gum Tacama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hac, and Caran; or if the Skin cannot bear Gums, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified ſpirit of Wine impregnated with Aromatic Plants and Seeds. However all Oily things ought to be careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avoided.</p>

                     <p>THE moſt common inſtance of Catarrhs is that call'd <hi>Coryza,</hi> or a defluxion of Matter from the Noſe, which at firſt is thin and ſharp; but in proceſs of time the nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Juice of the Noſtrils being deprav'd, renders it thick. The membran in the Head of the Noſtrils is frequently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd to Sneezing, and the Nervous <hi>Tubuli</hi> being likewiſe aſſaulted communicat their Convulſive diſorders to the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brana dura</hi> of the Brain; whence inſues a heavy pain, and a ſenſe of ſqueezing as it were in the Head. Sometimes the ſenſe of Smelling is quite loſt, and the Noſtrils are gall'd and ulcerated. The Cure is the ſame as that of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrhs in general. While the Humor is thin, we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Irritation by exhibiting inwardly volatil Salts; and applying outwardly the diſtill'd Oyl of Anis, or rather that of Amber, mix'd with a few drops of the Oyl of Cloves, with Cotton. The ſmell of the ſhavings of Horn, the ſteams of burnt Amber, Maſtic, Benzoin, Gum <hi>Animae,</hi> &amp;c. and the ſmoak of Tobacco impregnated with a few drops of the diſtill'd Oyl of Anis, are likewiſe very ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. When the Humor is thick, and the noſtrils ſtop'd, we muſt endeavor to attenuat and evacuat it, by fumigating
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:207638:217"/>with Vinegar upon hot Iron, or applying the ſpirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> or the Oyl of Almonds with Camphyr diſſolv'd in it, both to the extremity, and internal Membran. Sneez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Powders are alſo very uſeful, ſuch as the Powder of Florentin Orris with <hi>Euphorbium;</hi> the Powder of black Hellebor with Sugar. Tobacco-leaves ſprinkl'd with a few drops of the Oyl of Majoram, and dry'd; or mix'd with the Powders of Marjoram, Flowers of the Lilly of the Valley, diſtill'd Oyl of Anis, Amber, and Moſch. The ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of white Vitriol in the Decoction of Tobacco, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joram, and Flowers of the lilly Convally is alſo very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. If the Head be diſturb'd or clouded, we anoint the Crown of the Head with Balſam of <hi>Peru,</hi> or Oyl of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. If the Mouth be much moleſted, we order Troches of Mithridat, Maſtic, and Olibanum, to be roll'd in the Mouth.</p>
                     <p>As for the Cough, Hoarſeneſs, Blearedneſs of the Eyes, and all the other ſubdiviſions of Catarrhs, they are accounted for in their proper places.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THE Diſeaſes of the lower Region of the Body were our laſt Subject. It remains now to move upwards, and conſider the Diſorders of the Head. Where the Spirits are ſeparated and ſtrain'd from the Blood by the <hi>Glandules</hi> of the <hi>Cortical</hi> part of the Brain; and from thence convey'd to the Body. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Influence of theſe Spirits all Motion and Senſe ceaſes, as is evident by the Diſſection of a Nerve.</p>
                  <p>They require no Fermentation to fit 'em for their Office, being ſufficiently prepar'd by a bare Separation from the Blood; and are equally capable to ſerve any Senſe. The ſame Spirit that aſſiſted in moving the Muſcles of the Leg,
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:207638:218"/>would have ſerv'd the Eye in the ſenſe of Seeing. 'Tis true, the Spirits of one Man differ very much from thoſe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The different condition of the Maſs of Blood, and difformity of the Brain, occaſions a remarkable difference of Spirits, which is viſible in the variety of animal Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Thought and Genius among Men. Nay, in one and the ſame Man, any alteration of the Humors of the Body, and Maſs of Blood, produces the like change in the Spirits. When the Blood obſerves its regular Courſe, the Spirits are likewiſe orderly; and when 'tis inflam'd or boils too high, they become enormous, and cauſe a Perturbation in the Mind; which depends upon them, and can never pretend to Clearneſs and Juſtneſs of Thought, without the ſteddy and equal Influence of the Spirits. When their Motions are clever and ſwift, they cauſe a nimble and ready Wit; when they are lazy, and move heavily, they make a dull inactive Soul; and when their Motion becomes more languid, Sleep takes place; which is always introduc'd either by exhauſting the Spirits, by thickning and fixing them with ſleeping Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, by rendring them flaggy and dull, or clogging them with nutritious Juice or ſome ſerous Humor, that diſtils up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Brain in time of Watching.</p>
                  <p>To return to the Generation of the Spirits. It may be diſturb'd. 1. When the Spirits are deficient, for want of a due Exaltation of the Blood, or by reaſon of ſome fault in the Texture of the Brain, or an immoderat Conſumption by Exerciſe. This Symptom is cur'd by exhibiting gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and ſpirituous Medicines, as Spirit of Amber, Spirit of the Lilly of the Vally, with volatil Salt of Hartſhorn, and all the oily volatil Salts. 2. When the Spirits are numerous and crouded, which generally yields to Faſting, Sleeping, or Exerciſe. 3. When the Spirits are corrupted, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble rectify'd Spirit of Wine, and may ſuffer Depravation by mixing with foreign Spirits, or becoming phlegmatic, and degenerating from their volatil Subtilty, or by enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in irregular Motions.</p>
                  <p>Before I deſcend to Particulars, it will not be improper to premiſe three or four Poſitions that ought to be heedfully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Brain, Nerves, Membranes and Ligaments are all compos'd of little ſmall Fibres, which are ſtronger in the Nerves and extreme Parts of the Body, than in the Brain and <hi>Medulla Spinalis.</hi> Theſe Fibres are naturally bent and endow'd with a rebounding Virtue upon the approach of an
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:207638:218"/>external Object, or the impulſe of the Spirits from within. Their Texture is variable according to the Conſtitution of every Individual, and the different Motions of ſeveral ſorts of Spirits. From whence enſues the variety. of the animal or ſenſitive <hi>Phaenomena</hi>'s.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Brain and Spirits have a peculiar dependance upon the Moon; and upon that account the Diſeaſes of the Head encreaſe or diminiſh in proportion to its Age. The Spirits when diſorder'd are more ſenſible of this Influence than in their natural State. 'Tis true, the Sun has ſome Aſcendant over our Bodies, but that properly relates to the vegetable and vital Functions; the <hi>Animal</hi> Province being more peculiarly allotted to the Moon.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That there is an admirable Sympathy betwixt the Brain and the Bowels, eſpecially the Stomac. An ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Imagination diſturbs the Stomac, and Vomiting and Giddineſs do equally give riſe to one another. The Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Stomac and lower Belly have a viſible Influence upon the Fancy, as in the caſe of Hyſteric or Hypocondriac Fits, and the ridiculous Appetites of Women. <hi>Helmont</hi> was very happy in this Obſervation, and the practical Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences he deduc'd from it; but his Theoretic Conjectures are frivolous. The reaſon why the Spirits and the Stomac do ſo ſenſibly affect one another, ſeems to be this: That the Mouth of the Stomac is the firſt part of all the Body that receives any ſenſible Impreſſion in the Womb; for ſo much as all Alterations in the <hi>Embryo</hi> muſt be produc'd by the Nouriſhment convey'd to the Stomac. This eſtabliſhes an early Correſpondence betwixt it and the Spirits, and lays the laſting Foundation of their future Intimacy.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That the Spirits are liable to the ſame material Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with the Blood.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="chapter">
                     <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of immoderate Watchings.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>WE are ſaid to wake when the Spirits are diſtributed through the Organs of Senſe, and extend their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres. On the contrary, Sleep unbends the Fibres, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſons the Spirits. The Privation of which cauſes Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Body.</p>
                     <p>The immediate Cauſe of Watchfulneſs is a continued or violent Incurſion of Spirits into the Organs of Senſe. The
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:207638:219"/>remote Cauſe, barring ſome external Object, muſt either be the Diſorder of the animal Spirits, or ſome defect in the Brain. The Spirits are oft-times too nimble and moveable, as in young People and ſuch as feed high, and drink gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Liquors. The Heat of Summer, or travelling in a hot Climat, eating of Veniſon, immoderat Care, Study, and the Paſſions of the Mind, the acceſſion of foreign heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Particles from malignant Diſtempers, or drinking Tee and Coſſee, are the natural Cauſes of the Mobility and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of the Spirits, and conſequently of Watchfulneſs. As for the Brain, Watchings will inſue upon the Openneſs of its Pores, occaſion'd by a Dryneſs, or want of Moiſture to fill up the Intervals. This may happen through Faſting, or eating of ſharp volatil Meats, immoderat Venery, Sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſmoaking Tobacco (which, tho it be an Opiat, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſts the Moiſture of the Brain) an unſeaſonable Uſe of purging Medicines, or a Deficiency in the firſt Digeſtion, which not only affects the Spirits by Conſent, but robs the Brain of its wonted Recruits, in neglecting the regular diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the Chyle.</p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe is manifeſt of it ſelf. As for Prognoſtics; It infers a Weakneſs and Feebleneſs. 'Tis more ſufferable in Youth than in a State of Manhood, and among Men than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Female Sex. It portends ill in acute Diſtempers. But in Chronical Diſeaſes may be longer endur'd, tho 'tis oft-times follow'd by Phrenſies, Folly, or Stupidity.</p>
                     <p>The Cure is perform'd by taking off the remote Cauſes. If it be caus'd by the Inflammation and Impetuoſity of the Blood, a Vein muſt be open'd. If the Blood be ſharp and oppreſs'd with heterogeneous Particles, Purgation and Sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing take place. If it ſpring from the Diſorder of the animal Spirits, they muſt be reduc'd to Order by the uſe of pacific Medicines, ſuch as <hi>Opium</hi> or <hi>Laudanum opiatum,</hi> or their Compounds. <hi>Bartholetus</hi> commends the Eſſence of <hi>Opium</hi> prepar'd with Spirit of Vitriol or Spirit of Cockle; <hi>Ens Veneris,</hi> which conſiſts of Vitriol and Salt Armoniac, and likewiſe the Anodvn Sulphur of Vitriol are proper in this caſe. But in uſing Opium, we ought to obſerve theſe Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: Not to exhibit it when the Watchings are owing to the Efforts of Nature, endeavouring a Solution of a Diſeaſe; or when attended with a ſtraitneſs in the Breaſt, or diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of Breathing; or when they proceed from the defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency and want of Spirits, as in old Men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The mildeſt Opiats are the ſafeſt. Let them be given in ſmall Quantities, and repeated often, As,</p>
                     <pb n="437" facs="tcp:207638:219"/>
                     <p>Take of the Conſerve of wild Poppy Flowers one Dram, Venice Treacle or Diaſcordium half a Dram, <hi>Laudanum Opiatum</hi> one Grain. Make a Bolus. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of native Cinnabar fifteen Grains, <hi>Saccharum Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi> eight Grains, <hi>Laudanum Opiatum</hi> one or two Grains; with the Extract of Saffron make Pills to be taken in the Evening, about an hour before Supper. The Seed of Thorn Apple is of excellent uſe in this caſe.</p>
                     <p>As for the Watchings which ariſe from the Dryneſs and Openneſs of the Brain, moiſt and cooling, Medicines are moſt proper: ſuch as Emulſions, and other oily temperat Compoſitions.</p>
                     <p>Take of the four greater cold Seeds, of each half an Ounce, Garden Poppy Seeds two Drams, ſweet Almonds from two Drams to half an Ounce; with a ſufficient quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Water of Water Lillies make an Emulſion. Add of Cinnamom Water half an Ounce, and ſweeten it with Syrup of Poppies. Or the Emulſion may be accommodated to whatever acute Diſtemper accompanies the Watchings; as in a malignant Fever,</p>
                     <p>Take of ſweet Almonds and Garden Poppy Seeds, of each two Drams; of the four greater cold Seeds, of each a Dram: With Viper Graſs Water make an Emulſion: ſweeten it with pearl'd Sugar, and add half an Ounce of Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>namom Water, and a Scruple of Bezoar Mineral. It pacifies the Spirits, and obviats the Malignity of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.</p>
                     <p>The Decoction of Barley with Poppies and Liquorice is much applauded. And in general all moiſt, nouriſhing, milky, chilous Medicines are very conducive in this caſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, eſpecially the Seed of Thorn Apple; of the Fruit we make Pills thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of Thorn Apples ſix Pound, bruiſe and boil them in twelve Pints of Lettice Water to eight Pints; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Decoction, and digeſt it in the Sun: ſprinkle it with Spirit of Wine, and ſet it to dry. To an Ounce of the Juice thus thicken'd and dry'd add half an Ounce of Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron, and two Scruples of the Oil of Citron Peel. Make a Maſs for Pills. Doſe a Grain or two. It procures Sleep, and ſtops all Fluxes.</p>
                     <p>In the Watchings of old Men, or ſuch as proceed from a ſcarcity of Spirits, or a frigid Crudity in the Stomac, Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ats are inconvenient: Comforting and aromatic Medicines are only proper.</p>
                     <pb n="438" facs="tcp:207638:220"/>
                     <p>Some give Opiat Clyſters or Suppoſitories to procure Sleep; but 'tis a dangerous Method, unleſs the Watchings be accompany'd with a Looſneſs or Pains in the Guts.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>SLeep is accounted <hi>preternatural</hi> when the Spirits do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to the external Organs in their wonted Seaſon, but continue lock'd up within the Brain. If a ſcarcity of Spirits, and extreme Weakneſs, occaſion a ſhutting of the Eyes, 'tis not properly Sleep, but Swooning: As in the caſe of hyſteric Fits and Weakneſs after Child-birth, there firſt appears as it were a violent Inclination to ſleep, which preſently ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates in Swoonings.</p>
                     <p>If the Sleep be ſo profound, that the Perſon does not wake when jogg'd or call'd upon, but remains deſtitute of all Senſe and Motion, except Reſpiration, 'tis call'd a <hi>Carus;</hi> and if it proceed from any internal Cauſe, is a ſort of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy, and requires the ſame Cure. The external Cauſes are exceſſive Drinking, ſmoaking Tobacco, uſing Narcotic Medicines, the Steams of ſulphurous Minerals or ferment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Liquors, or new Plaiſtering upon the Walls of the Houſe, and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>When the Perſon doats in his Sleep, and readily anſwers upon a Call, but continues ſenſleſs, and preſently drops aſleep again, 'tis call'd a Sleeping <hi>Coma.</hi> If the Fancy be awake while the external Senſes are ſhut up by Sleep, and attended by frantic Outcries and irregular Motions of the Members of the Body, 'tis call'd a waking <hi>Coma;</hi> which ſeldom comes alone, but is generally follow'd by Phrenſies and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, and diſappears upon their Removal.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the ſtrength of Imagination is ſuch, that while the Perſon is aſleep, he not only ſpeaks and moves, but gets
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:207638:220"/>up and walks about, and attempts many fearful things, that when awake he would ſhrink to think of. This is rather a natural Infirmity, than a proper Diſeaſe. It is influenc'd by the Moon, and ſeems to be near akin to Hypocondriac Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy.</p>
                     <p>If the ſick Perſon be ſeiz'd with a ſleepy <hi>Coma,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al a ſlow Feaver, and a forgetfulneſs of what he does, ſpeaks, or demands, 'tis call'd a Lethargy; which is the only ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſtemper that requires Conſideration in this place.</p>
                     <p>The immediat Cauſe is the dulneſs of the Spirits. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Cauſes are, 1ſt, A Paucity of Spirits, occaſion'd by Bleeding, Venery, Watching, Fatigue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2dly, A watry or pituitous Humour, ſeparated from the Blood by the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules of the Brain, that blocks up the Paſſages and drowns the Spirits. Thus Children, Hydropic and Arthritic Perſons, and thoſe of a Phlegmatic moiſt Conſtitution, are ofttimes obnoxious to this Diſtemper. The Stone in the Kidneys, or any thing that ſuppreſſes the evacuation of the <hi>Serum,</hi> will give riſe to a <hi>Lethargy.</hi> 3dly, Narcotic Medicines, and ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Liquors, or poiſonous Fumes; which ſtupify the Spirits, by making ſuch alterations in the Humors of our Body, as are apt to produce a Numneſs. Thus the very Humors of our Body turn Narcotic, and have the like influence upon the Spirits; as new Wine by fermentation acquires a ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Quality, which formerly it had not. 4thly, The ſtagnation of the Blood, Contuſions, or Tumors in the Brain; which compreſs the Spirits, and ſtraiten their Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages.</p>
                     <p>Sleep diſtinguiſhes theſe Diſtempers from all others. The particular Symptoms that diſtinguiſh one ſleepy Diſtemper from another, may be gather'd from what is already ſaid.</p>
                     <p>As for Prognoſtics: Sleep in general is a bad <hi>Omen,</hi> and is more or leſs to be ſuſpected, according to the degree of ſleeping. A <hi>Coma</hi> is very dangerous in the height of an acute Feaver. If the Feaver intermit, or be accompany'd by evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, 'tis leſs hazardous, except it happen in the beginning. A <hi>Lethargy</hi> generally brings Death in ſeven days: If the ſick Perſon ſurvive the ſeventh day, he recovers. If 'tis fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by evacuations by Stool, by the Noſtrils, the Ears, or ſalivating Glandules, 'tis a tolerable ſign, eſpecially if the Feaver and other Symptoms relent. If the Symptoms are heighten'd, and the Body in the <hi>interim</hi> oppreſs'd by other Diſtempers, eſpecially thoſe of the Head, together with cold Sweats, 'tis a deſperat Caſe. A Phrenſy preceding a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy,
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:207638:221"/>makes it mortal: whereas if it follow after, 'tis a ſign of Recovery. If a Trembling ſucceed, it portends ill. If it come of its own accord, without the impulſe of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Cauſe, 'tis mortal.</p>
                     <p>In the Method of Cure, we muſt have regard to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Cauſes abovemention'd. If a Lethargy proceed from a prevalency of ſerous or pituitous Humors in the Blood, and conſequently in the Brain, Blood-letting is for the moſt part neceſſary, both by way of Averſion, Derivation, and Revulſion. It may be repeated according to the former ſtrength of the Patient. 'Tis better to bleed often, and draw forth but little at a time, than to take it all at once. In the beginning of a Lethargy from this Cauſe, 'tis not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to inject the following Clyſter.</p>
                     <p>Take of Wormwood, leſſer Centory and Rue, of each a handful; Pellitory Roots three Drams; Pulp of <hi>Coloquyntida</hi> ty'd in a Bag, from half a Dram to a Dram; boil them in common Water: To nine Ounces of the ſtrain'd Liquor, add Electuary of <hi>Hiera</hi> with <hi>Agaric</hi> one Ounce, Ox Gall thicken'd a Dram; Volatil Salt of Amber half a Dram, and the yelk of one Egg (or, if you deſign to make it very ſharp, half a Dram of Sal-gem) mix for a Clyſter. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Aſarabacca</hi> (or Tobacco) Leaves, the Herb Rue, the Flowers of leſſer Centory, Flowers of Arabian Stechas, of each half a handful; Bryony and Gentian Roots, of each half an Ounce, Pulp of Coloquyntida ty'd in a Bag a Dram and a half; boil them in common Water, or human Urin: in ſeventeen Ounces of the ſtrain'd Liquor, diſſolve of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuary of Hiera and Agaric one Ounce, Ox Gall thicken'd a Dram, Eſſence of Caſtor two Scruples; make a Clyſter. Or</p>
                     <p>Take of the Pouder of Hiera with Agaric a Dram and a half; Mice Dung, Ox Gall thicken'd, of each a Dram, with a ſufficient quantity of Honey of Roſemary Flowers, or Honey of Rue: make a Suppoſitory to be anointed with Oil of Myrrh or Coloquyntida.</p>
                     <p>If theſe prove ineffectual, 'tis proper to apply a bliſtering Plaiſter; as, Take of the Pouder of Spaniſh Flies, from a Scruple to two Scruples, Pouder of Euphorbium from half a Scruple to twelve Grains; Caſtor in Pouder, from fifteen Grains to a Scruple; with half an Ounce, or an Ounce of Capital Lees: make a bliſtering Plaiſter to be appli'd to the pit of the Neck, or behind the Ears, or to the back of the Head, or to the Arms or Legs. 'Tis a very effectual Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine in this Caſe.</p>
                     <pb n="441" facs="tcp:207638:221"/>
                     <p>If the Patient reap any Benefit by theſe preſcriptions, then 'tis time to preſcribe Vomits and Purges. The Antimonial Vomits are beſt. As for purging Medicines,</p>
                     <p>Take of Caſtor two Scruples, and prepar'd Scammony one Scruple, mix for two Doſes to be exhibited in <hi>Oxymel.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Quercetanus</hi>'s <hi>Extractum Phlegmagogum,</hi> from half a Scruple to a Scruple, Caſtor half a Scruple, Troches <hi>Alhandal</hi> two Grains, Roſin of Jalap one, two or five Grains. With the Eſſence of Caſtor make Pills: To which you may add ſome ſweet Mercury.</p>
                     <p>Next to evacuating Medicines, we exhibit the ſharp Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil Cephalics, which diſpel the ſerous Humour, and diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Spirits; ſuch are Spirit of Salt Armoniac, Spirit of Muſtard Seeds, Spirit of the Lilly Convally, Salt of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and eſpecially Caſtor. The Decoction of Tee is much commended in all ſleepy Diſtempers. The ſharpeſt Cephalic Medicines are beſt. As</p>
                     <p>Take of Marjoram and Rue Water, of each an Ounce and a half, Apoplectic Water ſix Drams, Eſſence of Caſtor a Dram and a half, Spirit of Soot two Scruples, Syrup of Betony one Ounce. Mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Spirit of Mother of Thyme, Spirit of Citron Peel, of each a Dram and a half; Spirit of Human Blood one Dram; Mix. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Conſerve of Sage, Conſerve of Roſemary and Lavender Flowers, of each one Ounce, the Pouder <hi>Dianthos</hi> a Dram and a half, Pouder of Cubebs a Dram, Muſtard-ſeeds and Caſtor of each two Scruples; with the Syrup of Piony Flowers make an Electuary.</p>
                     <p>If the Lethargy proceed from a narcotic Virulency that has ſeiz'd the Spirits, then the Volatil Acids are moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, eſpecially the Volatil ſpirit of Vitriol, and the Volatil Spirit of Verdigreeſe: They are given from twenty to thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Drops in any convenient Vehicle; to which Caſtor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ought to be added, it being an admirable ſpecific in theſe Caſes. When a Lethargy proceeds from this cauſe, preſcribe thus,</p>
                     <p>Take of black Cherry Water, Mother of Thyme Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of each an Ounce and a half, <hi>Myaſichtus</hi> his Hyſteric Vinegar, or Vinegar of Squills half an Ounce, Eſſence of Caſtor two Drams, Oxymel of Squills ſix Drams; mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of prepar'd Amber a Dram, Cinnabar of Antimony half a Dram, Caſtor two Scruples; make a Pouder for four Doſes.</p>
                     <pb n="442" facs="tcp:207638:222"/>
                     <p>After the uſe of theſe Medicines, the Cure may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated by the Sudorific decoctions of Woods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Next ſucceed the ſneezing and chewing Medicines, which evacuate by the Mouth and Noſe. To this purpoſe are the ſharp, pointed, irritating Medicines, which ought always to be mix'd with Volatil Salts; that ſo while the one irritates and provokes to an evacuation, the other may penetrate and prepare the Humor. As</p>
                     <p>Take of Pouder of Tobacco, Pouder of Lilly Convally, of each a Dram, white Hellebor Roots a Scruple, Caſtor from twelve Grains to a Scruple, diſtill'd Oil of Marjoram ſix drops; make a Pouder to be blown into the Noſtrils thro a Quill. Or</p>
                     <p>Take of white Hellebor, Caſtor, white Pepper, of each a Scruple; the diſtill'd Oils of Rue, of Marjoram and Sage, of each two drops; mix and make a Pouder for the ſame Uſe. This preſcription was peculiar to <hi>Timaeus.</hi> Or</p>
                     <p>Take of Treacle of <hi>Andromachus,</hi> two Drams, Extract of Caſtor half a Scruple, Pouder of Pellitory Roots, one Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, diſtill'd Oil of Amber ſix Drops; mix and make a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine for cleanſing the Palat.</p>
                     <p>To theſe we add the external Remedies. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of the diſtill'd Oil of Sage half a Dram, the diſtill'd Oils of Caſtor and of Amber, of each a Scruple; mix and make an Oil; with which anoint the Face and Temples, Or</p>
                     <p>Take of the diſtill'd Oils of Rue, of Savory, and of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Thyme, of each a Scruple, Caſtor half a Scruple. With a ſufficient quantity of ſome convenient Balſam, mix and reſerve for Uſe. Or</p>
                     <p>Take of Swallow Water prepar'd with Caſtor, two Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; the Spirit of the Cryſtals of Verdigreaſe, two Drams; mix and foment the Face and Temples with i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Take of the Herbs Savory and Rue, of each half a handful, Zedoary half an Ounce, Juniper-berries ſix Drams, Laurel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries half an Ounce, Muſtard Seeds and the Seeds of Water Creſſes, of each two Drams; boil them in a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent quantity of Vinegar, and foment the Face and Temples.</p>
                     <p>The Spirit of Vitriol and Vinegar applied to the Noſtrils, are of admirable uſe againſt feaveriſh <hi>Coma</hi>'s. As for the waking <hi>Coma</hi>'s, a Cataplaſm of a freſh Horſe Radiſh Root beat up with Rue, Vinegar, common Salt, and a ſufficient quantity of Lees, may be applied to the Feet.</p>
                     <pb n="443" facs="tcp:207638:222"/>
                     <p>If the Lethargy proceed from Mercurial or Sulphurous Fumes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> let a Vomit be exhibited upon the firſt view; then apply Vinegar and Caſtor to the Noſe, and likewiſe give it inwardly. Or thus,</p>
                     <p>Take of Mint Water, of Rue Water, of Rue Vinegar, of each an Ounce, Eſſence of Caſtor ſix-Drams, Syrup of Mint, or of the Juice of Citrons, one Ounce; mix, and let the Patient take a Spoonful often.</p>
                     <p>Where the immoderate Uſe of Opium cauſes a Lethargy, Vinegar of Rue, or of Squills, or of Vitriol, mix'd with Caſtor is a ſovereign Remedy; or if that prove ineffectual, add Muſtard Seed, or Rocket Seeds; or inject a Clyſter of Spaniſh Wine.</p>
                     <p>If any ſleepy Diſtemper enſue upon hard Drinking, let a Vomit be firſt exhibited; then foment the Forehead and Temples with Vinegar, mix'd with the Juice of Smallage; or apply the juice of Sengreen the greater, with Vinegar and Nitre, to the <hi>Scrotum.</hi> Spirit of Salt Armoniac, or of Soot are very ſerviceable in this Caſe.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole, the Remedies made uſe of in a Lethargy muſt be particularly appropriated to the Cauſe that produc'd it. If it proceed from an external Cauſe, Vomiting and the uſe of Vinegar with Caſtor, will finiſh the Cure: If it owe its Original to an internal Cauſe, or be preceded by other Diſtempers, the Cure muſt be vary'd according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Indications.</p>
                     <p>There is a near reſemblance betwixt theſe Diſtempers, and what we call a <hi>Catalepſis;</hi> in which the Patient is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of all Senſe and Motion, and ſeiz'd with a ſtiffneſs in his Members, tho moveable by any external impulſe, and apt to remain in the poſture they're left in. It is an uncommon Diſtemper, and very ſurpriſing, being accompany'd with a ſtaring of the Eyes, and diſtortion of the Countenance.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſe is the coagulation and fixedneſs of the Spirits: it may remotely proceed from Cold, ſuppreſſion of the Terms, Hypocondriac Fits, Worms, ſulphurous Fumes, and diſcontent of the Mind.</p>
                     <p>It is a dangerous Diſeaſe. As for the Cure, exhibit Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Vomits, and apply ſharp Cataplaſms or Suppoſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; Spirit of Wine is us'd in this Caſe both Internally and Externally.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>EXternal Senſe proceeds from the influence of outward objects upon the Organs, where the Nerves are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted. The Animal Spirits ought naturally to bend and extend theſe Nerves; ſo that when the outward Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities are mov'd, the ſame motion may readily be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the Spirits in the Brain. This ſecondary motion of the Spirits within, occaſion'd by the impulſe from without, is the foundation of internal Senſe; by virtue of which we form Idea's exactly parallel to the motion of the external Object. Thus, when the Arm is cut off, there ofttimes remains an imaginary pain, as if deriv'd from the firſt Finger.</p>
                  <p>Theſe outward Senſes are five in number, among which that of ſeeing is juſtly intitled to the nobleſt Character.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of the Diſeaſes belonging to the Eyes.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE Rays of Light are either convey'd to us in a direct line from a luminous Body, or reflected from the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of a dark ſolid Subſtance. If this reflecting Body be ſmooth and poliſh'd, the Rays are return'd in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and manner as they're receiv'd; if it be rough and unequal, they ſuffer various determinations according to the reſpective Figures and Texture of the Parts: from whence enſues the admirable variety of Colours.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Rays terminat in the <hi>Retina,</hi> where they form the inverted image of the Object, after having ſuffer'd a <hi>Decuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation</hi> in the Cryſtallin Humor: And the ſize of this imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Picture is augmented or diminiſh'd according to the proportional largeneſs of the Angles of <hi>Interſection.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſenſe of ſeeing may be extinguiſh'd or diminiſh'd, when the Rays of Light have not a free acceſs to the Eye, as when the Eyelids are ſeiz'd with a Palſy; which is cur'd by applying a Plaiſter of Tacamahac and Caran, or diſtill'd Oil of Tartar with Wax; or an Ointment of Balſam of Peru and <hi>Aqua Vitae.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="445" facs="tcp:207638:223"/>
                     <p>Sometimes the Rays are not admitted, by reaſon of a Web, or preternatural Tunicle covering the Eye: which proceeds from a corroſion of the Glandule in the internal cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Eye, by the ſharpneſs of the Serum, and ſome diſorder of the general Coat call'd <hi>Adnata.</hi> The nutritious juice of this Coat, and the Serum ſeparated by the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule being thus vitiated, congeal into a thicker Subſtance, which encreaſes by degrees, and at length covers the whole Eye. If the ſmall blood Veſſels, adjacent to the Glandule, be likewiſe vitiated, ſome ſtrokes of Blood appear in it, which is a ſign of Malignity; and if it be thick, rough, and painful withal, it approaches to a Cancer, and ought not to be meddled with. If it be thin, clear, and white, 'tis a good Sign. If it be inveterat, or attended by a ſuffuſion, 'tis ſafeſt not to touch it.</p>
                     <p>In curing the Diſeaſes of the Eyes, the following Cautions are fit to be taken notice of. 1ſt. That all ſharp irritating Medicines are improper. 2. That they ought to be neither very cold nor very hot, but temperat. 3. That when the Humors are ſharp, and apt to inflame the part, Wine is not convenient. Tho, 4. when a cold moiſture prevails, Wine, Fennel, Eyebright, and eſpecially the Decoction of Saſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fras, are incomparable internal Remedies. 5. That drinking of Spaw-Waters is very conducive in the end, tho it ſeem to offend the Eyes at firſt. 6. That <hi>Alcali</hi>'s are always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. <hi>Quercetanus</hi> prepar'd an excellent Water, thus,</p>
                     <p>Take of Childs Urine half a Pound, white Vitriol and Tutty, of each four Ounces, juice of Celandin two Pounds; let them ſtand to digeſt for ſome days; then diſtil and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Spirit for uſe. Others thus,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Roots of Celandin the greater, and of Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain, of each one Pound; of the Herbs Rue and Eyebright, of each four handfuls, Aniſeeds, Fennel-ſeeds, Lovage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeds, of each two Ounces, Marygold-flowers, Roſes, Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage-flowers, and flowers of Comfrey the greater, of each four handfuls, and fifteen Crabfiſhes; chop 'em all ſmall, and pour upon them equal quantities of the weak Spirit of Vitriol, and juice of Celandin: let them ſtand to digeſt for a Month, then diſtil, putting a dram of Camphyre into the Alembic; reſerve one half for uſe, add to the other half two Drams of <hi>Crocus Metallorum;</hi> let it ſtand for the ſpace of two Hours, and then ſtrain it. 'Tis an admirable Water for the Eyes. <hi>Hartman</hi>'s Eye Water was thus prepar'd.</p>
                     <pb n="446" facs="tcp:207638:224"/>
                     <p>Take of Fennel Water, Anniſeed Water, of each a Pound. Diſſolve in them half an Ounce of the pureſt white Vitriol. Then infuſe in it the Roots of Elecampane in Pouder: Strain the Liquor, and reſerve it in a Glaſs. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Water of the Flowers of Comfrey Royal, of Blew-bottle Flowers, of Night-ſhade Flowers, of each an Ounce: White Vitriol from half a Scruple to twelve Grains. To the ſtrain'd Liquor add half a Dram of prepar'd Tutty. Let it be dropt into the Corner of the Eye, or applied with a warm Cloth.</p>
                     <p>The beſt Method of uſing theſe liquid Remedies, is that the Patient be laid flat on his Back, and the Liquor drop'd into the Eye; and then the Eye muſt be carefully cover'd.</p>
                     <p>Bliſtering Plaiſters and Iſſues are very proper; as alſo a moderate uſe of ſneezing Medicines.</p>
                     <p>To return to the Web upon the Eye. It ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd either by reſolving Medicines, or by the help of a Needle. And afterwards Aſtringents ought to be applied. In order to the former, Sugar Candy, Honey, burnt Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn, Egg-ſhells, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are very proper either by way of Pouder, or form'd into an Ointment. <hi>Quercetanus</hi>'s Oph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalmic Water is generally us'd. 'Tis this;</p>
                     <p>Take of Eye-bright Water, Fennel Water, and Water of Celandin the greater, of each one Ounce, <hi>Crocus Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum,</hi> or Glaſs of Antimony, or Buttyr of Antimony a Scruple, let it ſtand warm for the ſpace of two or three Weeks: then ſtrain the Liquor, and drop it while warm into the Eye; for all cold things are hurtful to the Eyes. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Glaſs of Antimony pouder'd from half a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to fifteen Grains, infuſe it in Water of Blew-bottle Flowers, Eyebright and Fennel Waters of each one Ounce. Let them ſtand in a warm place over Night. In the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrain the Liquor, and add ſix Grains of Camphyr. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of Sal-gem a Dram, diſſolve it in Roſe-water and Fennel-water, of each one Ounce; mix for a <hi>Collyrium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Gall of a Pike and ſeveral other Fiſhes, alſo a Water drawn from human Gall, or from young Gooſe Dung, are by ſome reſerv'd for Noſtrum's. The following Water is incomparable, and much us'd.</p>
                     <p>Take a Veſſel of Braſs; pour into it half a Pound of quick Lime Water prepar'd with Water of Comfrey Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; and add half a Dram of Salt Armoniac. Let them ſtand till the Color alter.</p>
                     <pb n="447" facs="tcp:207638:224"/>
                     <p>The Juice of Celandin mix'd with the Dew gather'd from Fennel, or Eye-bright Water, is a great Specific in this caſe.</p>
                     <p>As for Pouders, white Vitriol leads the Van. Sometimes they're diluted with Waters, as,</p>
                     <p>Take of White Vitriol a Dram, prepar'd Tutty, Sugar Candy, <hi>Collyrium Albi Rhaſis,</hi> of each four Scruples, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyr ſix Grains, Roſe Water, Vervain Water, and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Flowers of Eye-bright, of each four Ounces. Mix. 'Tis good for removing Inflammations, as the following is for taking off the Web.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Bone of a Cuttle one Scruple, Sugar Candy one Dram, white Vitriol half a Scruple, prepar'd Tutty half a Dram: Mix for a Pouder. <hi>Riverius</hi> pilfer'd this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription out of <hi>Poterius,</hi> and was not ſo juſt as to take any notice of its Author. If you pleaſe you may dilute it with Celandin and Royal Comfrey Water, of each one Ounce.</p>
                     <p>Take of Blood-ſtone half a Scruple, white Vitriol fifteen Grains, Myrrh and Saffron of each five Grains, white Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Candy one Scruple; make a Pouder; or mix it with ſome convenient Water, and apply it to the Web with a Feather.</p>
                     <p>If ſuch Medicines prove ineffectual, we muſt have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to ſublimat Mercury. <hi>Plempius</hi>'s wonderful <hi>Arcanum</hi> was this.</p>
                     <p>Take of ſublimat Mercury from five Grains to half a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, diſſolve in Roſe Water, Eye-bright Water, and Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Water, of each one or two Ounces: Touch the Web with a Drop or two of this Liquor every Morning and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>The Juice of red Ants expreſs'd and drop'd into the Eye is of wonderful Succeſs.</p>
                     <p>Having thus conſider'd the firſt Obſtacle to the paſſing of the Rays of Light, the next is when the Horn Coat or White of the Eye is diſorder'd. This may happen, 1. When it is unequally nouriſh'd; or ſome Parts of it elated, while the others are depreſs'd, by reaſon of the Viſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the nutritious Juice. 2. When white Scars remain in this Coat, after the ſmall Pox or any other Ulcer. 3. When by an external Accident the Blood is forc'd out of its Veſſels, and creates an Inflammation.</p>
                     <p>The Signs are theſe. In the firſt caſe this Coat appears white and thick. In the ſecond we diſcover as it were a white Spot upon the Eye. The third is known by the blue livid Colour that attends it.</p>
                     <pb n="448" facs="tcp:207638:225"/>
                     <p>Children are more eaſily cur'd of theſe Maladies than adult People. If they are of a long ſtanding, 'tis a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult matter to remove 'em: only the laſt is generally more tractable.</p>
                     <p>As for the Cure: The Viſcidity of the Chylous Juice, and the Scars upon the Coat, ought equally to be remov'd by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuating ſharp Medicines; which ought to be ſomewhat ſharper in the latter than in the former caſe. The Seeds of <hi>Clary</hi> applied to the Eye, are converted into a Mucilage by the Lymph which waters thoſe Parts, and thus prove an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Medicine in this caſe.</p>
                     <p>The Gall of a Pike, or of a Partridg, and Ox Gall, or a Water diſtill'd from it, are much commended: they are us'd with the Water of Frogs Spawn. If the Scars or Clouds in the Eye ſucceed the Small Pox, exhibit what follows.</p>
                     <p>Take of Fennel Water two Ounces, of the Gall of an Eel from a Dram to a Dram and a half, Sugar Candy in fine Pouder a Dram: Mix, and let them ſtand warm for the ſpace of a Night.</p>
                     <p>The Spirit of Urine diſtill'd with Vitriol, the Juice of Eye-bright or. Fennel new drawn, mix'd with a little Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam of <hi>Peru,</hi> or rather the Juice of Fennel, mix'd with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar of Lead, are very proper to this purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>The Liver of a Lamprey melted into an oily Liquor, is accounted a Specific: 'Tis a ſharp Medicine, and ought only to be applied to the Eyelids, unleſs the Malady be inveterat. The Scar may be gently anointed with Oil of Paper or burnt Rags, with a Feather, or with the white Water of Honey. If the Cloud or Scar be inveterat, take the yellow Water of Honey, or the following compound Water.</p>
                     <p>Take of Honey from the Combs two Pound, tops of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Flowers, Eye-bright and Fennel tops, of each half a handful, Sugar Candy four Ounces. Diſtil in the <hi>Balneunt Mariae</hi> with a ſtrong Fire.</p>
                     <p>The Juice of Celandin the greater, or of Rue, or of Brook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime or its. Water, either drop'd into the Eye alone, or mix'd with Honey of Roſes, are of excellent uſe: As alſo the Water of quick Lime with Sal Armoniac, as above pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd; or <hi>Platerus</hi>'s famous Experiment, eſpecially if the Serum be ſharp or apt to inflame the part, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of the Pulp of four Apples half a Pound; chop 'em ſmall, and boil them in Roſe-water and Fennel-water, to the Conſiſtency of a Mucilage. Then add two or three Ounces of the Mucilage of Fenugree Seeds, and two or three
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:207638:225"/>Yelks of Eggs, half a Dram or a Dram of prepar'd Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and two Drams of the Rinds of Pomgranats pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd. Mix and make a Cataplaſm, to be applied and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually kept upon the cloſed Eye, and renewed twice a day.</p>
                     <p>The Waters diſtill'd from Cichory Flowers, or Blew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bottle Flowers, according to <hi>Schroder</hi> and <hi>Hoffman</hi>'s Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod: Fennel Water with the Gall of an Eel; the Pouder of the Bone of a Cuttle with white Sugar; the compound Pouder of Crabs Eyes, and the Scales of a Serpent, either blown into the Eye, or diluted with a convenient Vehicle, are all noted Specifics.</p>
                     <p>But above all ſublimat Mercury is the moſt effectual Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, exhibited as above.</p>
                     <p>When Children are ſeiz'd with theſe Diſtempers, the Nurſe or Mother may chew a little Fennel Seed, and then breathe upon the Child's Eye, or touch it with her Tongue.</p>
                     <p>When the Eye is beat black and blew by an external Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, apply Cloths dipt in Chervil-water, Hyſſop-water, or the Water of Blew-bottle Flowers. The chewing of Cumin Seed, or Fennel-Seed, or Cloves, and then breathing upon the Eye, is a celebrated Remedy. Fomentation with Wine, in which the tops of Hyſſop have been boil'd, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſucceſsful; but for a forlorn Hope take what follows.</p>
                     <p>Take of Comfrey Roots ſix Ounces, the Roots of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s Seal two Ounces; Elder Flowers an Ounce and a half, Meal of Beans one Ounce: mix; and uſe them by way of Decoction or Cataplaſm, or reduce them with freſh Butter into the form of a Liniment. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Roots of Comfrey the greater, and of the leſſer, of each half a Pound, Chamomile and Melilot Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, of each two Ounces, Meal of Beans four Ounces, freſh Butter three Ounces, Fenugrec Seeds one Ounce, Saffron half an Ounce: Boil them and foment with the Decoction; which is better than a Cataplaſm, by reaſon that all fat oily things offend the Eyes. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of Blew-bottle Flowers, and Flowers of Comfrey Royal, of each a little handful; tops of Hyſſop half a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Comfrey Roots three Drams, Roots of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Seal a Dram and a half; chop and beat them ſmall, and then boil them in a ſufficient quantity of Wine. Add to two or three Ounces of the ſtrain'd Liquor two or three Drams of Spirit of Wine camphoriz'd.</p>
                     <p>If there happen a Collection of Matter under this Coat, it muſt be drawn forth by the hand of a Surgeon.</p>
                     <pb n="450" facs="tcp:207638:226"/>
                     <p>Sometimes little Bliſters appear upon this and the <hi>native</hi> Tunicle, which are caus'd by the ſuppreſſion of ſharp Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. They are cur'd by applying <hi>Hartman</hi>'s vitriolated Water, or a ſimple Solution of white Vitriol; or by blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the following Pouder into the Eye.</p>
                     <p>Take of prepar'd Calaminar Stone half a Dram, prepar'd Tutty half a Scruple, Sugar of Lead half a Scruple: mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If the Bliſters are open'd, the Water of the Whites of Eggs is very proper.</p>
                     <p>Having thus diſpatch'd the Diſorders that may affect the Coats of the Eye, let us next conſider thoſe of the watry Humor.</p>
                     <p>The watry Humor is indiſpos'd when a viſcid Matter is mix'd with it, and interrupts the Rays of Light. This is call'd a <hi>Suffuſion.</hi> If the Matter harden into a Membran, 'tis call'd a Cataract. It generally ſticks cloſe either to the Horn, or Grape Tunicle, and ſeems to proceed from a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural Extenſion of its membranous Fibres. 'Tis always ſeated in the watry Humor, tho it ſometimes appears before the Coat call'd <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea,</hi> and ſometimes behind it.</p>
                     <p>If this Membran cover the whole Eye, the Sight is quite loſt; if it cover but the half, the Object appears half'd; if it exceed not the bigneſs of a ſmall Point in the middle of the Eye, and the Circumference is left open, the Objects appear as if holes were made in them. This laſt caſe is a true Suffuſion.</p>
                     <p>The Signs are theſe. In the beginning the Patient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of Flies, Smoak, Cobwebs, Filaments, and ſuch like, before his Eyes; the Color of Objects is alter'd; and they appear either multiply'd, half'd, or cut aſunder. Thus by degrees the ſight is darken'd, and the Apple on the Eye grows dusky. Some are ſeiz'd with Cataracts all of a ſudden, without any preceding Signs. If the Colour of the Eye turn perfectly white, 'tis a compleat Suffuſion.</p>
                     <p>As for Prognoſtics; a young Suffuſion is curable by the uſe of Medicines, but an inveterat one is only to be cur'd by a chirurgical Operation. If Light when brought near be quite imperceptible, Surgery it ſelf can afford no Relief. If the Eye affected be watry, and its Apple dilated while the other Eye is compreſs'd, 'tis ſome Incouragement for a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Operation. If not, 'tis a deſperate caſe. If the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ract be not ripe, and come to a ſufficient Conſiſtency, it ought not to be touch'd with a Needle, for fear the diviſion of it ſhould diſturb the watry Humor, or it reunite and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:207638:226"/>come more callous than before. If it be of a long ſtanding, it ſticks ſo cloſe to the Coats of the Eye, that it cannot be ſeparated without rending them. An aſhy colour'd Cataract is generally ripe in five or ſix Months. But if white, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires as many years. If blew or green, 'tis incurable. If yellow, it muſt be taken in time, elſe it becomes hard like a Horn. If the Cataract appear perfectly white, it is a ſign of Ripeneſs, and withal of its remarkable Thickneſs. In old Age a confirm'd Cataract from an internal Cauſe in one Eye portends the Invaſion of another in t'other Eye; and if couch'd, it generally returns. If the Headach either precede or accompany a Cataract, 'tis an ill Omen.</p>
                     <p>In the Method of Cure, regard muſt be had to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the Suffuſion; if the Patient be only moleſted with the appearance of Flies, Hairs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before his Eyes, 'tis in its firſt degree. When theſe filaments that cauſe ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances are gather'd into a Membran, 'tis arriv'd at the ſecond degree: If the Membran be ſo thick and confirm'd that there remains no manner of Sight, 'tis finiſh'd to the laſt degree.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt degree Medicines are only proper. In the ſecond they may likewiſe take place, but yield to manual Operation.</p>
                     <p>Internally we uſe Hoglice, Eyebright, Vipers boil'd in Ophthalmic Waters, the Decoction of Woods, Celandin, Vervain, Fennel, Betony, and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>The external Remedies muſt be very penetrating; Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monials are preferable to all others, by reaſon of an Acid ſubtil Sulphur couch'd within 'em. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of Glaſs of Antimony in Pouder, from half a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to fifteen Grains; infuſe in Water of Elewhottle Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Evebright-Water, and Fennel-Water of each one Ounce. Let them ſtand warm for the ſpace of a Night; in the Morning ſtrain the Liquor, and add ſix Grains of Camphyr-Drop it into the Eye, while the Patient is laid on his back. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Eggs of Ants four Ounces, and thirty Galls of Lampreys; mix and diſtil with a ſlow Fire. It yields a muddy Water, which ought to be ſtrain'd and applied to the Cataract in the Evening.</p>
                     <p>The diſtill'd Water of human Dung; with the Gall of a Lamprey, and Sugar-Candy diſſolv'd in it, is much commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Celandin the Greater, and River Crabs half putrified and diſtill'd, yield an Alcalin Water, of excellent Uſe.</p>
                     <p>If theſe Medicines prove ineffectual, we muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to <hi>Quercetanus</hi> his Ophthalmic Water prepar'd from
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:207638:227"/>a Child's Urine, and Vitriol: to which the juice of Celan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din may be added.</p>
                     <p>The White of an Egg harden'd, and fill'd with white Vitriol and Sugar Candy, and hung up in a Cellar, melts into a Liquor, which if diluted with Eyebright Water, is of admirable Uſe in this Caſe.</p>
                     <p>The Spirit of Salarmoniac ſharpen'd with Quicklime is the moſt penetrating Spirit, and preferable to Spirit of Wine, in which we are wont to dip Rags, and apply them to the Eye.</p>
                     <p>Bliſtring Plaiſters, Iſſues and Setaces are ſerviceable in the beginning, but are of no uſe in an inveterat Suffuſion. In room of them we may uſe what follows.</p>
                     <p>Take the Roots of Mezereon, and macerat them in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in which Nitre has been diſſolv'd, or in the Lees of Wine-aſhes, and afterwards dry them. Make a little hole in the teap of the Ear with a Needle, and put ſome of this Root thus prepar'd into it, after the manner of an Iſſue. It drains a great deal of Matter from the Head and Eyes.</p>
                     <p>In an inveterat caſe, 'tis probable a Salivation procur'd by Mercury may be ſerviceable. <hi>Fonſeca,</hi> Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> and <hi>Schenkius,</hi> were of the ſame Opinion.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the genuin Suffuſion above-mentioned, we meet ſometimes with a ſpurious ſort, which enſues upon Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriac Fits, long Faſtings, and the Paroxiſms of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Fevers. It generally depends upon the Diſorders of the Stomac, and oft-times diſappears upon eating, or at leaſt is cur'd by ſtomachic Medicines, <hi>viz.</hi> Aloe, Maſtic and Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                     <p>A Cataract ought likewiſe to be carefully diſtinguiſh'd from what we call a <hi>Glaucoma,</hi> that is, when the Chryſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin Humor loſes its Perſpicuity, and aſſumes a grey dusky Colour. Old People are naturally obnoxious to it, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their ſcarcity of Moiſture. For if we take out the Cryſtallin Humor, and put it betwixt us and Objects, it magnifies them; but if we dry it or boil it in hot Water, it becomes thick and untranſparent. 'Tis in vain to attempt the Cure in old Perſons. If the Patient be young, we fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Eye with Spirit of Wine, or a Cloth dipt in it, and apply'd to the Eye over Night. Or infuſe Borrage or Bugloſs Flowers in Spirit of Wine, and then uſe it. Some commend a Tincture of Bugloſs extracted with weak Alum Water, and the diſtill'd Water of the Whites of Eggs.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for the Obſtacles which may embarraſs the
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:207638:227"/>Paſſage of the Rays of Light. If the Patient be inſenſible of their Influence when they have a free Admiſſion, the fault muſt lie in the optic Nerve, and 'tis call'd a <hi>Gutta Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rena.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Obſtructions or Compreſſions of the optic Nerve inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Paſſage of the Spirits to the Eye, and ſo cauſe the Blindneſs. And a Tumor, or Collection of watry Humors in the Brain, or a violent Commotion occaſion'd by a Fall, Sneezing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> An unſeaſonable Uſe of ſudorific Medicines, or the Tranſlation of a morbific Matter to the Head, may occaſion this Diſorder of the optic Nerve within the Brain.</p>
                     <p>If nothing diſturb it within the Brain, the Error muſt be lodg'd in its Expanſion call'd the <hi>Retina,</hi> as when it becomes paralytic, languid, or otherwiſe indiſpos'd by a Blow upon the Eye, a Fall upon the hinder part of the Head, violent Sneez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſtrong Convulſions, or a continu'd gazing on the Sun or full Moon; the Violence of whoſe Rays weakens and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves the Fibres of the Tunicle. Colic Pains, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially exceſſive Venery (a mortal Enemy to the Eyes) may produce the ſame effect. Child-bearing Women are ſometimes ſeiz'd with this Diſeaſe, which diſappears upon their Delivery. In like manner it is ſometimes caus'd by a Suppreſſion of the terms, and vaniſhes upon their Return.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Gutta Serena</hi> is diſtinguiſh'd from the other ſorts of Blindneſs by this; that theſe advance by degrees, according to the gradual Diſorder of the part which cauſes 'em: Whereas it ſeizes on a ſudden, and quickly arrives at its height. The Signs drawn from the Dilatation and Conſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Apple of the Eye are not to be credited.</p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe is not eaſily cur'd. If the Nerves be tore, or the Sight quite gone, there is no hope. Old People ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver recover, for the Relaxation of the Optic Nerve is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral in them. If the Cauſe be moveable, and the Diſeaſe yet imperfect, there remains ſome ground of Hope.</p>
                     <p>Among the internal Medicines, thoſe which evacuat by Stool and Sweating are firſt in order. Vomits are not ſafe, nor ſtrong Purgations. The meekeſt Purgatives, ſuch as the Pills call'd. <hi>Aloephanginae,</hi> or the Decoction of <hi>Senna</hi> with Agaric and Salt of Tartar, are only proper on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Or, they may be join'd with Alteratives, thus.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Herb Eye-bright one handful, Betony Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Flowers of Comfrey Royal, Blew-bottle Flowers, of each two little handfuls: Leaves of Senna without the Stalks one Ounce, Roots of black Hellebor, and of common Spurge
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:207638:228"/>the greater, of each two Drams: Fennel Seeds, Cubebs, and Cardamoms, of each three Drams: Salt of Tartar one Dram: Cut and beat them ſmall to be ty'd in a Bag, and infus'd in Wine. Of which exhibit a Draught to the Patient Morning and Evening.</p>
                     <p>Saſſafras and the ſudorific Woods are beſt for Sweating. As for <hi>Alteratives,</hi> the mild oily Aromatics which are tinctur'd with a gentle Bitterneſs, are only proper. All ſharp and fierce Medicines inwardly taken are very offenſive to the Eyes, as Onyons, Garlic, Spirit of Sal Armoniac, Horſe Radiſhes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore they ought to be carefully avoided. Eye-bright and all its Productions are admirably good. Next to it are Valerian, Celandin the greater, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage, Fennel, Juniper Berries, <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> Rue, the four hot Seeds, Elecampane and Roſemary. We uſe to tie them in Bags to be infus'd in Wine. The following Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is much approv'd.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Herbs Betony, Celandin the greater, Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bright, Lovage, Anifeeds, Lovage Roots, Valerian Roots, and Chinamom, of each a Dram: Cardamoms, Ginger, Galangal, Fennel Seeds, Parſley Seeds, Seeds of Mountain Siler, and of the Herb wild Marjoram, of each half a Dram; Sugar one Ounce; make a Pouder to be taken ſome time before eating, as likewiſe along with Victuals. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Pouder of Falcons Dung dry'd two Drams, Fennel Seeds one Dram: Mix, for a Pouder to be taken every day.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Innocent</hi> the 3d was wont to do mighty feats with an Electuary made of Fennel Seeds, the Seeds of Mountain Siler, Smallage, Dill, and Parſley Seeds, with Honey.</p>
                     <p>Ants, Earthworms and Hoglice, and their various Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, are very uſeful. Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> commends the Infuſion of Hoglice in Wine.</p>
                     <p>If a <hi>Gutta Serena</hi> proceed only from a want of Spirits, occaſion'd by Venery or exceſſive Evacuations, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo proper as a moderat Diet, and Food of eaſy Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
                     <p>As for external Applications, <hi>May</hi> Dew gather'd from Fennel, Antimonial Infuſions, diſtill'd Waters from the Galls of Fiſhes or Gooſe Dung, are celebrated Remedies. The Liquor or Oil of the Liver of a Lamprey, the Fat of Vipers, and the Juice of Ants clarify'd by ſtanding, are all good. The Oil that melts from Earth-worms, Glaſs, and fermented Bread, is very effectual; it muſt be ſtrain'd thro
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:207638:228"/>a thick Cloth, and ſharpen'd with a little Camphyr, and gently laid upon the Eye. <hi>Brendelius</hi> admires the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ointment.</p>
                     <p>Take of Honey of Roſemary Flowers, ſcum'd, Ginger in Pouder, Cloves pouder'd, and common Salt, of each half an Ounce: Mix them for a liquid Ointment; of which put about the bigneſs of a Muſtard Seed into the Eye: It will make it ſmart at firſt, but is a very innocent Medicine.</p>
                     <p>Chewing and ſneezing Remedies are likewiſe not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Bliſtering Plaiſters may be applied behind the Ears, or to the Pit of the Neck, or to the Head it ſelf; and Iſſues or Setaces may be cut in the Neck.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of the Diſorders of the Ear.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE Senſe of Hearing is occaſion'd by the Motion of the Air in the Ear; and is rendred agreeable or diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable, violent or flat, according to the Proportion of the Air's Impulſe upon it, which is communicated to the Brain by a particular Nerve, ſet apart for that purpoſe. This Nerve detaches a ſmall Branch to the Teeth, which cauſes the Sympathy that is obſerv'd upon the approach of any ungrateful Sound.</p>
                     <p>This Senſe is ſometimes weaken'd or quite loſt, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times vitiated. The former may be caus'd by malignant, acute or chronical Diſtempers, and is taken for a good ſign in Fevers. It inſues upon the cutting off or wounding of the external part of the Ear; which Defect is in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſupplied by holding one's Hand or ſome artificial Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in its place. It may be caus'd by an Obſtruction in the Paſſage for Hearing, or a Diſorder in the Membran, which preſerves the Nerve and internal part of the Organ from external Injuries. This Membran may be injur'd by violent Sounds, Ulcers in the Ear, or a redundancy of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum in the Brain, which unbends it, and ſo indiſpoſes it for receiving the Impreſſion of the Air. It becomes ſometimes paralytic, and liable to Convulſions, and is oft-times affected by the Diſorders of the Stomac.</p>
                     <p>If the Animal Spirits have not a free Paſſage in the Hearing Nerve, Deafneſs will inſue. Their Paſſage may be diſturb'd by a wrong Inſertion of the Nerve, by a Compreſſion or
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:207638:229"/>Obſtruction, occaſion'd by external Accidents or Defluxions within, or by the above-mention'd Diſorders of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bran, which is nothing elſe but the Expanſion of the Hearing Nerve.</p>
                     <p>Deafneſs is manifeſt of it ſelf. The greateſt difficulty is to diſtinguiſh the Cauſes, which muſt be indeavour'd by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring into the Patient's Conſtitution, the Accidents that preceded, and the Paſſions or Diſorders which accompany it.</p>
                     <p>In the buſineſs of Prognoſtics, we muſt have regard to its Companions. If it ſucceed to a Chronical Diſtemper, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a formal Diſeaſe by it ſelf, 'tis a difficult Matter to remove it. In acute Diſeaſes, if the Urine remain crude, and the Perſon is ſeiz'd with a Deafneſs, it portends Doat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If it be accompany'd with the ſigns of Concoction, it ſignifies the Solution of the Diſeaſe. If attended by a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation of the Eyes, a Heavineſs in the Head, and a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtention of the lower Belly, it beſpeaks a Bleeding at the Noſe; eſpecially if the Patient be apt to rub it. A Deafneſs ſucceeding to Doating, is a better Circumſtance than if it went before.</p>
                     <p>As for the Cure. In acute Diſeaſes it diſappears upon the Solution of the Diſeaſe; or if it continue longer, is cur'd by Cupping behind the Ears, or ſmoaking Tobacco, or putting into the Ears a little Cotton dip'd in <hi>Aqua Anhaltina.</hi> If it ſubſiſt by it ſelf, without any dependance upon other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, the Cure muſt be accommodated to the Cauſe that produces it. If it ariſe from an Obſtruction in the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, occaſion'd by the hardening of the Earwax or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, 'tis cur'd by injecting the Juice or Eſſence of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, or Child's Urine, or the Spirit of Urine unrectify'd. If it proceed from other internal Cauſes, a tender regard muſt be had to the Drum and the hearing Nerve, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving their due Order with Aromatic and Nervous Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines. In a Catarrhous caſe give internally what follows.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Eſſence of Roſemary Flowers, of Saint <hi>John</hi>'s Wort, and of Saſſafras, of each two Drams: mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Amber given inwardly, or apply'd to the Ear in a little Cotton, is an admirable Medicine for old People. Moſch or Civet, or Balſam of Peru diluted with Spirit of Wine, or <hi>Origanum</hi> Water diſtill'd with Wine, or the Water of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duus Benedictus</hi> rectify'd by frequent <hi>Cohobation,</hi> are all us'd externally the ſame way. If Deafneſs be attended by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Heat in the Ears, the Water that drops from one
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:207638:229"/>end of a piece of Aſh-wood, while t'other is put into the Fire, or the Water of Ants, or the Water diſtill'd from Flies, or Magpy Water with Caſtor; or the Juice of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhes, or of Onions, mix'd with Oil of Amber and Oil of Bitter Almonds, are all applauded Remedies; and are to be us'd with Cotton, or a Linnen Cloth.</p>
                     <p>Above all, the penetrating Aromatics, as Spirit of Treacle, Eſſence of Wormwood and of Cloves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are preferable. Human Gall, or the Galls of other Animals infus'd in Spirit of Wine, are much commended. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of Ox's Gall and Spaniſh Wine, of each equal Quantities: diſtil from them a Liquor to be drop'd into the Ear, or applied in Cotton or a Linnen Cloth.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Roots of black Hellebor half a Dram, Roots of Aromatic Calamus two Scruples, Pulp of Coloquintida a Scruple, Bay Berries a Dram, Cumin Seeds from two Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to two Drams and a half. Cut and beat them ſmall, and infuſe them in four Ounces of Spirit of Wine: and uſe the ſtrain'd Liquor as above, or ſharpen it with Eſſence of Amber.</p>
                     <p>All Preparations from Ants are of wonderful uſe in this caſe. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Eggs of Ants one Ounce, and ſix Galls of Hares; beat them up with a double Quantity of Hony, and then drop it into the Ear. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take twenty of the little white Worms that are found be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>twixt the Bark and Wood of an Oak-tree. Let them boil in two Ounces and a half of the Oil of unripe Olives. Then take the Root of Sowbread, and cut it hollow. Fill the hollow ſpace with the Oil of theſe Worms, and add of prepar'd Pellitory Roots, and of the Roots of Aromatic <hi>Coſtus,</hi> from half a Scruple to a Scruple; Oil of <hi>Coſtus</hi> or of Rue as much as it can hold. Cloſe up the Root and roaſt it under the Aſhes; then bruiſe it in a Mortar, and with force expreſs the Juice; and pour ſome Drops of it into the Ear every day for ten ays together. <hi>Timaeus</hi> and <hi>Heertodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> recommend it for an incomparable Remedy.</p>
                     <p>The Fat of Serpents or of Vipers, or the Fat that drops from roaſted Eels, are proper in this caſe, and may be mix'd with the Oil of Amber or Aniſeeds.</p>
                     <p>Some commend a Fumigation of the Ears from a mixture of Sal Armoniac, Oil of Tartar <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> and a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble quantity of Quicklime with common Water.</p>
                     <p>After the application of theſe external Remedies the Ear
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:207638:230"/>ought always to be ſtop'd with Cotton, and Amber or Musk upon it; and the Patient muſt lie upon the ſound Ear, that ſo the Virtue of the Medicines may penetrat the more. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, 'tis to be remark'd, that oily viſcid Medicines are not ſo mild as thoſe of a thin ſpirituous Subſtance; and that they ought never to be applied till the Ear be purg'd and wip'd clean. All Medicines thus applied muſt be juſt luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm, and two or three Drops may always ſuffice for one time.</p>
                     <p>If Deafneſs come by Fits, or depend upon a Catarrhous Diſpoſition of the Brain; juſt before the Invaſion of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxiſm, 'tis proper to apply to the Crown of the Head a Cloth dip'd in Apoplectic Spirits or Oils.</p>
                     <p>If it be occaſion'd by a vehement Noiſe, 'tis not amiſs to apply hot Bread from the Oven with Juniper and Bay-Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries baken into it. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Herbs Marjoram, Sage, Roſemary, and the Flowers of red Roſes, of each half a handful, Juniper Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries one Ounce, Cumin Seeds half an Ounce; chop and beat them ſmall, and ſtitch them into a Bag, to be applied hot; or wet with a convenient Vehicle.</p>
                     <p>A Fumigation receiv'd at the Ear from a Decoction of Filings of Steel, with diſtill'd Vinegar and Cephalic Herbs, or from the Flowers of Sulphur, is much eſteem'd. After the Fumigation is over, apply to the Ear diſtill'd Oil of Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel with Cotton.</p>
                     <p>In Chronical or Catarrhous Caſes the hot Baths are very proper, both for Bathing and Pumping upon the Head. An Iſſue cut in the Arm of the ſame ſide with the affected Ear, is likewiſe very uſeful on this occaſion.</p>
                     <p>If Deafneſs be caus'd by a Fall, Contuſion, or external Violence, diſtill'd Soubread Water is a proper Remedy; and a Plaiſter made of equal Quantities of Tacamahac and Cerecloth of Betony may be applied to the Head ſhav'd. Hot Urine taken from a hunted Hare is commended by ſome.</p>
                     <p>If any Obſtruction or ſuch like cauſe give riſe to a Deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, 'tis probable a Salivation procur'd by Mercury may be uſeful. But 'tis a deſperate Cure, and muſt be cautiouſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken.</p>
                     <p>Thus I've diſpatch'd the firſt Branch of the Diſorders of the Ear; the next is when the Senſe of Hearing remains, and the Patient is moleſted with a tingling or noiſe in his Ears. It proceeds from a preternatural Motion of the internal Air
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:207638:230"/>contain'd in the Cavity of the Ear, which affects the Fibres of the Drum, and ſo repreſents an imaginary Sound.</p>
                     <p>This Motion may be occaſion'd by ſubtil foreign Fumes exhal'd from the Blood in the adjacent Arteries, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the Repoſe of the internal Air; or by the Irritation or violent miſplacing of the Drum from any internal or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Cauſe. Convulſions of this Membran may be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd by the Inflammation of the Blood in a Headach or Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and in that caſe vaniſh upon bleeding at the Noſe: Or by a Catarrh, or Tranſlation of morbific Matter, as in the Declenſion of Feavers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If a Tingling in the Ears accompany other Diſtempers, it affords the ſame Prognoſtics as Deafneſs. If it ſubſiſt by it ſelf, it is not very dangerous, unleſs it be inveterat, in which caſe it proves a Forerunner of an Apoplexy. If it proceed from frequent Blows, it terminates in a total Privation of Hearing.</p>
                     <p>The Cure is perform'd by the ſame Medicines as above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd; eſpecially Fumigations, and the Application of Aromatic Spirits and Oils.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Leaves and Flowers of Chamomil one hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: Dill or Sage, Marjoram, Roſemary, of each half a handful; Millet Seeds toſted one Ounce, drv'd Salt half an Ounce; chop them ſmall, and make a quilted Bag, to be applied warm to the Ear.</p>
                     <p>The Vapor of new Bread from the Oven, with Cumin Seeds, Fennel Seeds, Aniſeeds, Origanum, Mother of Thyme, and Bay-Berries, fermented and bak'd with it, is ſometimes uſeful, but not always. The Oil of Oak-worms above pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd, or expreſs'd Oil of Peach Seeds, with Peach Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers infus'd in it, are very proper. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of white Hellebor and Caſtor, of each two Drams; ſweet Coſtus a Dram and a half, Rue two Scruples, Euphor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium half a Dram; Oil of Bitter Almonds, or Peach Seeds, one Ounce. Boil them gently in a ſufficient quantity of Oil of Rue, and apply it to the Ear with Cotton. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Roots of white Hellebor three Drams, Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves and Rue of each half a handful: Aſh-leaves one hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: Boil them in Oil of Bitter Almonds, or of Nut's with White or Spaniſh Wine, till the Wine be conſum'd. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Oil, and apply it to the Ear. Or infuſe the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in Spirit of Wine, and extract and Eſſence for the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Fumigation from a Decoction of Muſtard-ſeeds in Wine
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:207638:231"/>is commended. In a pituitous Conſtitution apply what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Oil of Henbane, and of Rue, of each half a Dram; diſtil'd Oil of Marjoram half a Scruple, Caſtor ſix Grains, Saffron four Grains: Mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it proceed from a Fall, Contuſion or external Violence, take a Spoonful of the Spirit of Scurvy-graſs, and half a Spoonful of freſh Juice of Onyons, and four or five Drops of diſtill'd Oil of Spike. Mix and drop it into the Ear.</p>
                     <p>In Plethoric and young Perſons 'tis not amiſs to breathe a Vein in the Arm, and exhibit ſome mild ſneezing Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines. If it come by Fits, follow the Courſe preſcrib'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove. If it attack Hypochondriac Perſons, it generally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Diſorders of the Stomac and lower Belly, and is cur'd by Chalybeats, Carminatives, and volatil uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Salts, together with the uſual Specifics.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of the Senſe of Feeling, and the Diſorders 'tis obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE third Senſe is that of Feeling, occaſion'd by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of external Objects upon the nervous Glandules ſeated in the Skin. 'Tis true, the nervous Fibres within the Body that are not glandulous, are deeply ſenſible of the lighteſt touch; but their Senſe is painful and preternatural, whereas that of the Glandules is equal and agreeable to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Upon which account Feeling is their peculiar Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and the Liver which has no Nerves or nervous Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules is deſtitute of that Senſe.</p>
                     <p>This Senſe is quite extinguiſh'd in Apoplexies, Palſies, and ſtupifying Diſeaſes. Of which more in their proper places.</p>
                     <p>The moſt remarkable Depravation of the Senſe of Feeling is what we call <hi>Pain;</hi> that is, when the Object makes ſuch a ſenſible Impreſſion upon the Organ, as to provoke the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits to irregular Motions, and diſturb the repoſe of the nervous Fibres, which readily impart their Diſorder to the Brain. It may be call'd a convulſive Motion of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres; and Experience teaches us, that Convulſions and Pain are reciprocal Cauſes to one another.</p>

                        <head>ART. I. <hi>Of Pain in general.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THE remote Cauſes of Pain are innumerable, for every particular Object has a peculiar way of affecting the Nerves. The external Cauſes are manifeſt: The internal Cauſes are generally the Offspring of vicious Acids; which partake of ſharp and ſtiff Parts, that are apt to make painful Impreſſions upon the nervous Fibres. This Acid for the moſt part owes its being to ſome defect in the Stomac and firſt Paſſages; and varies the Nature of the Pain according to its changeable Circumſtances. If a volatil ſharp Acid be join'd to a viſcid Vehicle, it takes deep rooting in the Part, and creates immoveable Aches, as in Venereal and Colis Pains. If the Acid be more gentle, and join'd to a thin Vehicle, it produces a fluctuating Pain. If it proceed from a particular defect in the Part affected, 'tis apt to recur and cauſe Relapſes. According as this Acid is diſpos'd, the Pain is either continu'd or intermitting; it either obſerves ſet Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, or attacks indifferently in all Seaſons. And ſometimes it cauſes Swellings, by contracting the Fibres, and ſtraitning the Pores of the Part, ſo as to put a ſtop to the Circulation of the Blood.</p>
                        <p>In order to form a diſtinct Idea of Pain, I ſhall divide it into ten ſorts. The firſt is a weighty burdenſom Pain ariſing from a Collection of inſipid or viſcid Matter lodg'd in a leſs ſenſible Part, as the Swelling of the Liver. 2. A pungent Pain arifing from a ſharp pricking Acid in a membranous part, as in a Pleuriſy. 3. A pointed penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Pain, reſembling the Senſe of a Hole made by an Aul, proceeding from a viſcid Matter that partakes of Acidity: As in St. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Fire and Arthritic Pains. 4. A beating Pain which generally keeps pace with the Pulſe of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. It proceeds from a violent Diſtention of the Fibres, which are exaſperated by the Incurſion of the Blood; as in Headaches, or when ones Finger is prick'd by a Thorn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 5. A breaking Pain, peculiar to the <hi>Perioſtium,</hi> reſembling the breaking of the Bone. 'Tis produc'd by a ſharp Acid lodg'd in a tenacious Matter: as in Venereal Caſes. 6. A rending or diſtending Pain. The former is peculiar to Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriac Perſons, and Parts that have no exquiſit Senſe, but are inveſted with a ſenſitive Membrane. The latter is
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:207638:232"/>caus'd by Wilid, or any thing that overcharges the Part, and ſtretches the ſurrounding Membran. 7. A tearing Pain peculiar to the Membranes, and frequent in ſcorbutic Caſes. 8. A burning Pain, peculiar to Fibres and Membranes, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from a volatil Acid, and the boiling of the Humors within the Part. 9. A ſtupid chilly Pain. And, 10. A biting gnawing Pain.</p>
                        <p>If Pains be accompany'd by an intermitting Pulſe, 'tis no juſt Cauſe of Fear; for when the former diſappears, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter returns to its wonted Order.</p>
                        <p>There are three ſorts of Medicines made uſe of for Pains, 1. All Alcali's apt to deſtroy a prevailing Acid: As Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Dill, Elder, Mint, Chamomile, Bay-leaves, Pellito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Wall, and the other ſoftening Herbs; Fumigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with Amber, or the Spirit of Amber both inwardly and outwardly. The volatil Remedies prepar'd from human Urine, and the Parts of Animals, are all proper Antidots againſt a volatil Acid. As for example:</p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Aqua Articularis</hi> (for external uſe) from an Ounce and a half to two Ounces, Spirit of Urine or Spirit of Sal Armoniac prepar'd with Quicklime ſix Drams, putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd Earthworms, or Earthworms mix'd with a volatil Salt, two or three Drams: Mix and bathe the Part affected. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Leaves of Tobacco, of Sage, of Roſemary, of each one handful, Angelica Roots half an Ounce, Roots of Cuckow Pint and Pelſitory of <hi>Spain,</hi> of each two Drams, Roſemary Flowers, Lavender Flowers, and Flowers of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian Stechas,</hi> of each two little handfuls; Rocket Seeds ſix Drams, Caſtor three Drams; pour upon them two Pints of Spirit of Wine, and one Pint of Spirit of Worms. Let them ſtand warm for ſome days in a cloſe Veſſel. And then ſtrain the Liquor to be us'd as above.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Venice</hi> Soap diſſolv'd in Spirit of Wine is good for Arthri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Pains. In caſe of a burning Pain it ought to be mix'd with Water of Frogs Spawn or Spirit of Wine with Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyr and Saffron. Camphyr, Oil of Frogs, and the Oil of the Juice of Dwarf-Elder, and all emollient Oils, are conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient in Arthritic Pains. <hi>Paracelſus</hi>'s Oil prepar'd from <hi>Galbanum,</hi> with Turpentine, and Oil of Spike, and the Oils diſtill'd from Aromatic Seeds, from the Bones and Fat of Animals, or from Wax, digeſted with Spirit of Wine, are celebrated Medicines in all Pains ariſing from an Acid. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of Balſam of <hi>Peru</hi> one Ounce, diſſolve it with the
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:207638:232"/>Yelk of an Egg, and add three Ounces of the Spirit of Juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Berries, or of Elder Flowers: Mix for external Uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                        <p>The Gums and Plaiſters prepar'd from 'em are proper in the caſe of a viſcid Acid. And likewiſe Cataplaſms of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Dung, or the Dung of Animals with Oil of Roſes. Among Purgatives in this caſe ſweet Mercury is the beſt. And Sudorifics are the beſt internal Medicines.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. All Anodyn Pacific Medicines are us'd for Aches. As Milk, Emulſions, Mucilages or Oils of ſoftening Herbs. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſms made of white Bread, Milk and Saffron. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Crum of white Bread a ſufficient quantity, let it ſoak in Cows Milk: Mix it with Yelks of Eggs and freſh Butter, and an Ounce and a half of the Oils of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momile, Dill, white Lillies and Earthworms. Apply it to the Part affected with a warm Cloth. Swallow-water, with Caſtor, Liniments of the Fat of Animals, and emollient Oils, and all oily ſoftening Liquors or Ointments, are all proper for external uſe.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Narcotic Medicines ſtupify the Part, and ſo leſſen the Senſe of Pain. But where a viſcid Acid prevails, they are inconvenient. In caſe of a ſharp Serum they are not amiſs. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Hypnotic Ointment two Drams, expreſs'd Oil of Nutmegs two Ounces, Oil of Henbane Seeds one Ounce: mix. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of Oil of Dill and expreſs'd Oil of Poppies, of each a Dram, Oil of Henbane half a Dram: mix.</p>
                        <p>The Oil of the Seeds of Henbane mix'd with Camphyr, Saffron, and Spirit of Wine, cover'd with fermented Dough, and bak'd in an Oven, yield an incomparable Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor for Pains of the Legs.</p>

                        <p>THeſe Pains are frequently met with in Scorbutic Caſes.</p>
                        <p>They proceed from a ſubtil Acid fix'd in membranous and muſculary Parts: And generally rage more by Night than by Day.</p>
                        <p>Blood-letting ſometimes gives Relief. Bliſtering Plaiſters conveniently applied, and Iſſues, are oft-times not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>

                        <p>The volatil Sudorifics, Decoctions of Woods, and all vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil Alcali Salts, ſuch as we call Antiſcorbutic, together with Anodyn Abſorbents, as Chalybeat and Antimonial Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, are proper to be given inwardly.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Roots of Swallow-wort an Ounce and a half, Myrtle Leaves one handful, Seeds of <hi>St. Johns Wort,</hi> and choice Rhubarb, of each a Dram and a half. Boil them in common Water, and in ſix Ounces of the ſtrain'd Liquor diſſolve an Ounce and a half of the Syrup of Maidenhair. Mix and give it inwardly. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Shavings of Juniper-wood three Ounces, Sprouts of a young Pinetree two handfuls, of the Herb Roſemary one handful. Infuſe them in ſix Pints of ſimple Water, and let them ſtand over night in a <hi>Balneum Mariae.</hi> In the Morning boil it to four Pints, and give it for a Draught. It has a peculiar Virtue in the Obſtructions of the Glandules about the Head and Chops.</p>
                        <p>External Medicines muſt be cautiouſly us'd; fat unctuous things are hurtful.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Spirit of Lilly of the Valley (not much recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd) four Ounces; Spirit of Sal Armoniac prepar'd with Quicklime two Ounces, Eſſence of Caſtor half an Ounce: Mix for external Uſe. Or,</p>

                        <head>ART. III. <hi>Of the Toothach.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THE Toothach proceeds from an acid Humor that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodes the Membrane ſurrounding the Tooth. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the nutritious Juice of the Teeth is vitiated, and cauſes the Pain. Sometimes an acid Humor is diſtill'd from the neighbouring Glandules, or collected in the Cavities of the Bones of the upper Jaw under the Eye, and gives riſe to it.</p>
                        <p>This Corruption of the Humor ſometimes runs to that height, that the Subſtance of the Teeth is eaten away, and little Worms ingendred in 'em.</p>
                        <p>The Membrane is the original Seat of the Pain, which oft-times ſeizes the whole ſide of the Head, attended by an Inflammation of the Jaw, or a Swelling of the Face. For the nervous Fibres being contracted in Sympathy with the Membrane, the Paſſages of the Blood and other Juices are ſtraitened.</p>
                        <p>The remote Cauſes are a Depravation of the Juices of the Body, and conſequently of the nutritious Juice of the Teeth, as in Scorbutic and Venereal Caſes; the uſe of acid Liquors, Sugar, or Honey; which ferment and acquire a notable Acid, very prejudicial to the Subſtance of the Teeth.</p>
                        <p>The Toothach is not dangerous of it ſelf; but may be follow'd by Convulſions, Inflammations, Tumors and Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</p>
                        <p>If the Tooth be corrupted, it muſt be drawn. If it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a Scorbutic Cauſe, Antiſcorbutics muſt be added to the Remedies exhibited. If from a venereal Cauſe, the Decoction of Guajacum, or its Oil, muſt be us'd.</p>
                        <p>As for the common Remedies, ſome uſe Decoctions of Herbs. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Herb Arſmart, Mother of Thyme, of each one handful; Dock Roots, Nettle Roots, of each one Ounce; Pellitory (of <hi>Spain</hi>) Roots, the Shavings of Boxwood, the Shavings of <hi>Lignum Sanctum,</hi> of each half an Ounce; Seeds of white Henbane, one Dram. Boil them in a ſufficient Quantity of Water. Strain the Liquor for a Gargal.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Heurnius</hi> commends the Decoction of Tobacco with Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momile Flowers. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of black Pepper, Roots of Pellitory of <hi>Spain,</hi> Seeds of Staveſacre, of each an equal quantity: boil them in Wine, and uſe it for a Gargal. Or,</p>
                        <pb n="466" facs="tcp:207638:234"/>
                        <p>Take of Juniper Gum one Ounce; boil it in a Pint of Wine, for the ſame uſe. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Flowers of Spikenard a convenient Quantity: boil them in Wine for the ſame uſe. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Extract of <hi>Guajacum</hi> Wood three Grains, <hi>Laudanum Opiatum</hi> two Grains, diſtill'd Oil of <hi>Origanum,</hi> or of Cloves two Drops. Make Pills to be put into the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Tooth. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Flowers of <hi>Benzoin</hi> ſix Grains, <hi>Opium</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd in Spirit of Wine and thicken'd three Grains: with a ſufficient quantity of the Extract of Triacle, make Pills as above. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Laudanum Opiatum</hi> one Scruple, Oil of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyr, Oil of Cloves, of each five Drops. With ſome conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Balſam, make a Balſam to be applied to the Tooth.</p>
                        <p>If the Face be inflam'd, apply a Plaiſter of Triacle to the Cheek. Spirit of Sal Armoniac prepar'd with Spirit of Wine and Quicklime, with Camphyr diſſolv'd in it, appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Cotton to the Tooth, gives preſent Relief. The Eſſence of Saſſafras prepar'd with Spirit of Wine is very proper: But above all the Eſſence of <hi>Benzoin. Elixir Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietatis</hi> prepar'd without an Acid is oft-times uſeful. The Aromatic diſtill'd Oils (eſpecially of Savin) mix'd with Oil of Henbane, are preferable to Eſſences. <hi>Sulphur Auratum An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonii,</hi> Oils of Amber, Hazel, Boxwood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſucceſsful.</p>
                        <p>The Surgeons are wont to apply Plaiſters to the Temples, or the following Plaiſter to the whole Part inflam'd.</p>
                        <p>Take of Triacle of <hi>Andromachus,</hi> Tacamahac, of each half an Ounce; Balſam of <hi>Peru</hi> a Dram. Spread it upon a Linnen Cloth for uſe. If the Toothach cauſe an Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion like to St. <hi>Antony</hi>'s Fire,</p>
                        <p>Take of Triacle of <hi>Andromachus,</hi> from half an Ounce to ſix Drams; Salt of Wormwood, Balſam of <hi>Peru,</hi> of each a Dram: Mix and apply. If it be attended by a Swelling of the Jaws, 'tis not fit to provoke 'em to Suppuration. But,</p>
                        <p>Take of Chamomile Flowers, Elder Flowers, of each a handful; Roots of Florentin Orris in Pouder, half an Ounce: mix 'em with expreſs'd Oil of Poppies; make a quilted Bag, and apply it hot to the Part affected.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes indeed there happens a little Tumor in the Gums, at the very Root of the Tooth, which ought to be ſuppurated by warm Milk or roaſted Figs, and afterwards kept clean with Honey or the like.</p>
                        <pb n="467" facs="tcp:207638:234"/>
                        <p>If the Toothach be inveterat, and do not yield to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Medicines, 'tis neceſſary to purge with Jalap, and let Blood, and apply Cupping-glaſſes to the Neck and Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
                        <p>If the Tooth be corrupted, it muſt be drawn with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Inſtrument. Before drawing 'tis not amiſs to apply the following Ointment in order to looſen the Tooth.</p>
                        <p>Take of Gum Ammoniac, Seeds of Henbane, Juice of Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane, of each a Dram and a half: with the Fat of a green Frog, and a little Wax, make an Ointment.</p>
                        <p>In the caſe of Worms in the Teeth, the Decoction of Savin in Wine is proper. If the Tooth be rotten, an actual or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential Cautery will prevent its further Corruption.</p>

                        <p>AN Inflammation, or the ſharpneſs of the Serum, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Accidents, may cauſe Pains in the Eyes. If any external thing lurk in the Eye, it muſt be taken out by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Seed of Clary, or a little Pearl, or Crabs-eye, into it. If the Pain proceed from a ſpontaneous Inflammation, the Mucilage of Seeds of Quinces extracted with Water of Frogs Spawn, adding five or ſix Grains of Camphyr and as much Saffron to three Ounces of Mucilage, ought to be laid upon the Eyes.</p>
                        <p>Fennel-water with Sugar of Lead and Camphyr is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe proper. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Water of Celandin the greater, Water of Blew-bottle Flowers and of Larks Spur, of each one Ounce; white Vitriol twelve Grains; ſtrain the Liquor, and add half a Scruple of prepar'd Tutty; to be applied to the Eye with a Linnen Cloth.</p>
                        <p>Of all external Applications, the following Cataplaſm is the beſt.</p>
                        <p>Take three ſweet Apples boil'd and ſqueez'd, and roſted under the Aſhes, and the White of one Egg well mix'd with two Drams of Loaf-ſugar, and twelve Grains of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyr, with five Grains of Saffron: Mix for a Cataplaſm to be laid upon the Eye. Some recommend the opening of an Artery in this caſe.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes we meet with a preſſing, tearing Pain, which comes in an Evening without any evident Cauſe, and
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:207638:235"/>ſeems to proceed from the Convulſions of the Coats of the Eye. In which caſe Antimonial Infuſions are proper. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Mucilage of Plantain Seeds, Quince Seeds, and Clary, extracted with Water of Frogs Spawn, of each one Ounce; Saffron ſix Grains, Camphyr four Grains. Or,</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>THE Pains of the Ears are for the moſt part occaſion'd by the Diſorders of the internal Membran; by Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, and the Corroſion of ſharp Humors, or of Worms either ingendred in the Ear, or receiv'd from without.</p>
                        <p>An Inflammation is very dangerous, and attended by a remarkable Heat that is not obſerv'd in the caſe of ſharp Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors. Worms are diſtinguiſh'd by an Itching and Senſe of Motion within the Ear.</p>
                        <p>As for Cure, the following Cataplaſm is univerſally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded.</p>
                        <p>Take an Onion roſted under the Aſhes, with an Ounce and a half of Oil of Chamomile, and half an Ounce of Oil of Dill, with as much freſh Butter, and a Scruple of Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron. It is a ſovereign Remedy for the Inflammations that follow the Toothach.</p>
                        <p>The ſoftening Oils, Infuſions of Tobacco, or the Smoak of it, convey'd into the Ear, and eſpecially the Oils of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects, are all very proper. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Oil of Scorpions one Dram, Oil of ſweet (or bitter) Almonds, diſtill'd Oils of Anniſeeds and Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, of each half a Scruple. Pour it hot into the Ear, or apply it with Cotton.</p>
                        <p>In the caſe of an Inflammation; Take of the Juice of Houſeleek; Oils of Scorpions, of Earthworms and of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momile, of each a Dram: Mix and uſe as above.</p>
                        <p>If there be no ſuſpicion of an Inflammation, the diſtill'd Vegetable Oils of Origanum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are proper. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take a hundred of the largeſt Eggs of Ants, Caſtor, Pulp
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:207638:235"/>of Coloquintida, Marjoram, Savin, Wormwood and Rue, of each one handful. The Seeds of Cumin, Aniſeeds, Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel-ſeeds, and Caraway-ſeeds, of each three Drams.

Sometimes ye may add a ſmall quantity of Opium.</p>
                        <p>If the Pain be occaſion'd by Worms, they ought to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic'd to come forth by pouring in ſweet Milk, or applying a ſweet Apple roſted to the Ear. If they refuſe to come forth, they muſt be kill'd by bitter Oils and Juices. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of the expreſs'd Oil of Peach-ſeeds one Dram, <hi>Quer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetanus</hi>'s Oil of <hi>Coloquintida</hi> half a Dram, ſweet Mercury from ſix Grains to half a Scruple: Mix and pour it in by Drops, or apply it with Cotton. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of Aloe two Drams, Myrrh from a Dram to two Drams, Coloquintida half a Dram, tops of Wormwood half a handful. Boil them in a ſufficient quantity of Wine or Water, and uſe the ſtrain'd Liquor as above.</p>
                        <p>If an Ointment be more acceptable; take of Salt of Lead, Earwax, and expreſs'd Oil of Filberds, of each an equal quantity: Mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fumigations by the bitter Herbs and Antimonial Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, are proper both for the Ear and Mouth.</p>
                        <p>If a Flie creep into the Ear, put a little Turpentin into it: If a Flea, put a little Ball of Dogs-hair: If a Leech, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Solution of common Salt, or the warm Blood of any Animal.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>SOmetimes the whole Head is ſeiz'd with an univerſal Pain; at other times only a particular part, as the hinder part of the Head in Women, which generally ſlows from the Diſorders of the Womb; the external Membranes ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scull, in venereal Caſes; and the internal Membran call'd <hi>dura Mater,</hi> from the Indiſpoſition of the Blood, which it receives by an infinit number of capillary Veins.</p>
                        <p>If the Headach be not originally caus'd by ſome Diſorder in the Head, it oft-times proceeds from thoſe of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac,
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:207638:236"/>the Spleen, the Kidneys, the Womb, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by reaſon of the mutual Commerce eſtabliſh'd betwixt them and the Head, by virtue of their Membrans and Nerves.</p>
                        <p>If it proceed immediatly from ſome defailance in the Head, it may be caus'd accidentally by external Wounds, uſe of Mercury, immoderat Drinking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and diſappears upon their removal. If it become habitual and inveterat, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds either from an Inflammation of the Blood in the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the Brain, or the Depravation of the <hi>Lympha</hi> ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by its Glandules, or a collection of ſome heterogeneous Humor which oft-times ſettles into a viſcid Conſiſtency, and creates particular Pains confin'd to narrow Bounds, as the breadth of an Egg, the head of a Nail, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The only uſe of Signs in this caſe is to diſtinguiſh the Cauſes: If 'tis inconſtant, and apt to relent, or be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd by Diſorders in the lower Region of the Body, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any viſible defect in the Head, it is owing to the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of theſe other affected Parts. If it be habitual, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſet Periods in returning, and be influenc'd by the Sun and Moon, 'tis an eſſential Headach. And if it cauſe a Senſe of beating, like to that of an Artery, and a burning Heat, it proceeds from the Blood. If it increaſe after eating, or vaniſh after Sleep, it ariſes from the Depravation of the Chyle. If attended by a Drouſineſs, a ſenſe of Weight, and a ſeeming Diſtention of the Brain, it proceeds from ſome ſerous or viſcid Matter lodg'd in the Head. If fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by ſcorbutic or venereal Symptoms, they diſcover the Cauſe.</p>
                        <p>As for Prognoſtics. If in Feavers it ſuddenly vaniſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Evacuation, 'tis an ill <hi>Omen.</hi> If attended by grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Symptoms, as Giddineſs, Convulſions, Vomiting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'tis not eaſily cur'd. If a drouzy Headach ſeize a Child-bearing Woman, it is dangerous. If accompany'd by a Coldneſs of the external Parts, it betokens an inward In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation. 'Tis more ſuſpected in acute than in chronical Diſeaſes.</p>
                        <p>In order to a regular Cure, 'tis needful to obſerve the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Cautions. 1. If it ariſe by conſent with other Parts, it yields to Vomiting, Purging, and the Reſtoration of the diſorder'd Part. But if it be eſſential and inveterat, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Evacuations are not ſo proper as corroborating cepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Medicines.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Opiats are not very proper in eſſential Headaches. At leaſt they muſt be given in ſinall Doſes; and if externally
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:207638:236"/>us'd, muſt not be applied to the Sutures, but to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Forehead.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. 'Tis always conducive, excepting the caſe of a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Feaver, to keep the Belly open.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The ſcorbutic Pains of the Head are the moſt obſtinat. The Decoctions of ſudorific Woods, volatil Salts and Spirits, Milk, Opiats, bliſtering Plaiſters, and external Anodyn Applications, are proper in ſuch caſes.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. In all Headachs the Decoctions of the ſudorific Woods ought to ſucceed to the general Evacuations.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Chirurgical Operations are of great uſe. If it proceed from the Blood, open a Vein in the Arm, or the Vein of the Forehead, or the Vein betwixt the Thumb and firſt Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; or apply Leeches to the Temples; or open the Artery that runs along the temporal Muſcle towards the Forehead, which gives preſent Relief, and is a very innocent Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if cautiouſly perform'd. If it ariſe from a Depravation of the Serum, apply bliſtering Plaiſters behind the Ears, or over the whole Head; or cut Iſſues in the Arm, Neck, or Head it ſelf. Trepanations are ſometimes, but very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, convenient. Cupping Glaſſes are not amiſs. But the univerſal Evacuations ought to precede all chirurgical At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. If the Headach ariſes by Conſent, Vomits are proper. But if it be eſſential, Purges are more convenient. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Pills of Maſtic a Scruple; extract of black Hellebor, extract of Caſtor, of each five Grains; Troches Alhandal two Grains; with a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Elixir Proprietatis,</hi> make Pills. They are likewiſe proper againſt the Diſorders of the Stomac and lower Belly, which oft-times cauſe a Head-ach.</p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Crollius</hi> his <hi>Extractum Panchymagogum,</hi> or extract of black Hellebor fifteen Grains; Extract of Vervain ſeven Grains; ſweet Mercury from half a Scruple to fifteen Grains; Laudanum Opiatum two Drams, Scammony Sulphurated two or three Grains; with a ſufficient quantity of the Eſſence of Saffron, make Pills. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of Extract of Agaric half a Scruple, Extract of black Hellebor ſix Grains; Aloe prepar'd with Juice of Roſes, Roſin of Scammony, of each three Grains; diſtill'd Oil of Roſemary Flowers, or of Origanum, one drop. Mix and make Pills. In a pituitous Headach,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Pills <hi>Aloephanginae</hi> with <hi>Diagrydium</hi> one Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Roſin of Jalap ſix Grains; with Eſſence of Amber, make Pills. Or,</p>
                        <pb n="472" facs="tcp:207638:237"/>
                        <p>Take of the Conſerve of Roſemary Flowers one Dram, Cream of Tartar half a Scruple, Golden Sulphur of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony five Grains, Roſin of Jalap four Grains. Make a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Roſemary always ought to be added to the ſudorific Decoctions. The volatil Salt of Amber, Camphyr, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aphoretic Preparations of Antimony, and urinous volatil Salts, are proper Alteratives in all Pains of the Head. The Decoction of Tea in Wine or Water, the Eſſence of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the volatil Spirit of Vitriol, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are of the like nature.</p>
                        <p>Take of prepar'd Amber from half a Scruple to fifteen Grains, Cinnabar of Antimony half a Scruple, Laudanum Opiatum one Grain, diſtill'd Oil of Saſſafras one Drop. Mix for a Pouder. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of native Cinnabar or Cinnabar of Antimony a Scruple, Extract of the Wood Aloe fourteen Grains, Extract of Caſtor eight or ten Grains, Laudanum Opiatum four or five Grains. Make Pills for four Doſes. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Conſerves of Sage Flowers, Roſemary Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Clove Gillyflowers, of each ſix Drams; Amber a Dram; native Cinnabar, or Cinnabar of Antimony half a Dram; of the Pouder <hi>Diambra,</hi> and of the Pouder <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſchus dulcis,</hi> of each two Scruples, with Syrup of Clove Gillyflowers make an Electuary. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of black Cherry Water, Vervain Water, of each one Ounce; Water of Lilly Convally prepar'd with Wine ſix Drams; the Spirit of Harts-horn with Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber two Scruples, Syrup of Betony three or four Drams. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Spirit and volatil Salt of Harts-horn three Drams; Eſſence of Opium tartariz'd one Dram: Mix. Doſe forty or fifty Drops. Or,</p>

                        <p n="14">14. If the Headach be caus'd by external Accidents, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the following Plaiſter.</p>

                        <p>The Ointment of Alabaſter, or <hi>Hartman</hi>'s Bag of Amber with the Eſſence of Pepper, or a Plaiſter of Tacamahac with Oil of Amber, are very uſeful on this occaſion.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. If the Pains of the Head are caus'd by Worms, Take of the Pouder of Aloe and of Earthworms, of each two Drams; the Gall of a Bull a Dram, Oil of Wormwood and Wax, of each a ſufficient quantity for a Plaiſter, to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Head.

A Cataplaſm of the Root of a wild Cucumber, or Bryony, with Vervain and Wormwood, or a Decoction of them, may be applied to the Part affected. Or,</p>

                        <head>ART. VII. <hi>Of Arthritic Pains.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THE Parts immediatly affected are the membranous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments ſurrounding the Joints. The Cauſe is a vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Acid join'd to the Spirits, which gnaws the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brans, and thickens their nutritious Juice. This Acid takes its firſt riſe from the Diſorders of the Stomac. It diſplays it ſelf in the Foot, and is call'd the Gout; in the Huckle Bones, and is call'd the Sciatica; in the Hands, and ſeveral other Parts of the Body. Sometimes 'tis hereditary. In other caſes 'tis acquir'd by the uſe of acid Wine, Venery and Paſſion, or any Commotion of the Spirits that increaſes the Acid in the Body.</p>
                        <p>This Acid affects chiefly the ſolid Parts, and ſerves to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purat the Blood and fluid Humors. When it invades a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Part, it leaves ſome ſmall Particles in it that afterwards revive, and make a new Paroxiſm.</p>
                        <pb n="477" facs="tcp:207638:239" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <p>The Paroxyſm is uſhered in by a Conſtipation of the Belly, difficulty of Breathing, an unſufferable Heat at the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac, Thirſt and loſs of Appetite. In the Gout the great Toe is firſt affected; in the Sciatica the Huckle Bone, where it receives the Bone of the Thigh, and all the Membrans from thence downward to the Foot are contracted. If the Acid be ſharp and fiery, theſe Symptoms are aggravated; if it be viſcid, and what we call cold, the Symptoms are weaker, and the Fits of a longer Duration.</p>
                        <p>In forming Prognoſtics, we may expect the Paroxyſm when the wonted Excrements betwixt the Toes diſappear, and the Belly is conſtipated. The Sciatica is more obſtinat than the Gout; which if inveterat, hereditary, or attended by Nodes, is incurable in old Men. If the Joints adjacent to the Original of the Nerves be ſeiz'd, it portends Death. If any part be put out of Joint by arthritic Pains, 'tis a hard matter to ſet it right. The frequency of bad Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and the moving of the Pains towards the Throat and upper Parts betokens Death. If the Paroxyſm do not finiſh its Courſe, but break off abruptly, 'tis an ill Omen.</p>
                        <p>As for the Cure. When we foreſee a Paroxyſm, 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient firſt to exhibit the Pouder of Crabs Eyes with Salt of Tartar and <hi>Oſteocolla;</hi> then a Vomit, and afterwards the following Purge.</p>
                        <p>Take of Cream of Tartar, Salt of Wormwood, <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num duplicatum,</hi> of each eight Grains; <hi>Digrydium</hi> three Grains: make a Pouder. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Conſerve of Roſemary, Conſerve of Sage, of each ſix Drams; <hi>Paracelſus</hi> his purging Pouder for the Gout a Dram and a half; Roſin of Jalap half a Scruple; with Syrup of Buckthorn, make an Electuary.</p>
                        <p>All purging Medicines ought to be avoided during the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the Fit; but after it has paſs'd the height, and the Feaver and other Symptoms have diſappear'd, give what follows.</p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Ruffius</hi> his Pills <hi>de tribus,</hi> Extract of black Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebor, of each half a Scruple, Turbith Mineral prepar'd with Spirit of Sulphur two or three Grains: make Pills.</p>
                        <p>Opiats ought never to be us'd, but after the univerſal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuations, and along with purging and ſweating Specifics. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Pills <hi>Aloephanginae</hi> two Drams, <hi>Laudanum O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatum</hi> half a Dram; make Pills for four Doſes, to be taken in Wine, faſting three or four hours after.</p>
                        <pb n="478" facs="tcp:207638:240" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <p>Take of prepar'd Crabs Eyes, <hi>Mynſichtus</hi> his <hi>Arcanum Duplicatum,</hi> of each twelve Grains, Salt of Amber ſix Grains, Hyſteric Laudanum three Grains: make a Pouder. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of Triacle from half a Dram to a Dram, Salt of Wormwood a Scruple: with Wine make a Draught. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of Fennel Water, Water of <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> of each an Ounce and a half; Spirit of putrified Earthworms a Dram and a half; Salt Armoniac, Magiſtery of Corals pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with Juice of Citrons, of each half a Dram; <hi>lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Opiatum</hi> two Grains, Syrup of Orange Peel half an Ounce: mix.</p>
                        <p>In Arthritic Pains Blood-letting is pernicious. But in the Sciatica, 'tis needful in the beginning of the Paroxyſm, to open a Vein in the Foot of the ſame Side with the affected Part. Clyſters ought to be injected, during the whole Courſe of the Paroxyſm.</p>
                        <p>The Specifics that are proper in the Paroxyſm are ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Medicines, both fix'd and volatil, as red Corals, Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar of Antimony, volatil Salt of Hartſhorn or of Vipers; Spirit of Sal Armoniac, Volatil Spirit of Tartar, and the Decoction of Sudorific Woods: Antiſcorbutics ought to be mix'd with 'em.</p>
                        <p>External Medicines ought not to be applied till the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm have arrived at its height. In a hot Gout, attended by Inflammations, take Quick Lime and Sal Armoniac; pour Spirit of Wine upon 'em, and diſtil, adding to the diſtill'd Spirit a little Camphyr. Apply it to the Part. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Aqua Articularis ad extra</hi> two Ounces, Spirit of Worms an Ounce, Spirit of Sal Armoniac three Drams: mix and uſe as above. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take a ſufficient quantity of Elder Flowers beaten, put 'em into a new earthen Veſſel, ſo that the Veſſel may be full: ſtop it cloſe, and ſet it under ground till the Flowers be converted into a Liquor: to be applied hot with a Cloth.</p>
                        <p>Mullen Flowers, Henbane Flowers, may be boil'd in Milk; or the Leaves of Valerian or Burdock may be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Part with good Succeſs. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Crums of white Bread three Ounces, Pouder of Marſhmallow Roots one Ounce, Flowers of Chamomile, Meal of Beans half an Ounce, Meal of Linſeeds and Fenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grec, of each three Drams. Boil them in a ſufficient quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Milk, to the Conſiſtency of a Pultiſe: then add of <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Anodynum</hi> an Ounce, Balſam of Soap two Drams: with the Yelk of one Egg, make a Cataplaſm.</p>
                        <pb n="479" facs="tcp:207638:240" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <p>The Lean of Beef applied to the Part, and chang'd Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Evening, is much commended. Human Dung and Urine are likewiſe proper. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of Ox Dung one Pound, Roſe-water, and Water of Speedwel, of each two Ounces; the Yelk of an Egg beaten up with a little Allum, Saffron a Dram, Camphyr a Scruple. Mix.</p>
                        <p>The Plaiſter of Frogs Spawn with a large quantity of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar of Lead, or <hi>Tachenius</hi>'s Plaiſter <hi>de Alcalibus,</hi> with Camphyr, are proper. All oily things ought to be avoided, and the Cataplaſins or Plaiſters frequently renew'd.</p>
                        <p>If the Gout be cold, Spirit of Sal Armoniac prepar'd with Quicklime and Spirit of Urine may be applied. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of Venice Soap an Ounce and a half, Camphyr ſix Drams, Caſtor half a Dram. Diſſolve in a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Spirit of Earth Worms. Apply with a Feather to the Parts affected.</p>
                        <p>The Oil of Soap, or the Roots of black Hellebor boil'd in Rock Oil; or Balſam of Peru mix'd with the Yelk of an Egg and Spirit of Worms; or Tacamahac, mix'd with Oil of Amber; or <hi>Myſinchtus</hi> his Diaphoretic Plaiſter, mix'd with Triacle and ſtinking Oil of Tartar; or Triacle mix'd with Spirit of Salt Armoniac, are all much eſteem'd in this caſe.</p>
                        <p>Bliſtering Plaiſters ought to be cautiouſly us'd. In a cold Gout perhaps they are not amiſs.</p>
                        <p>If the Pains are follow'd by Nodes or hard Swellings, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Spirit of Quick Lime or old Cheeſe with the Decoction of Pork, or a thin plate of Lead to the part.</p>
                        <p>The Cure of the Sciatica differs in ſome things from that of other arthritic pains. In this Leeches applied to the Hemorrhoid Veins are very uſeful; after which inject ſharp Clyſters, as,</p>
                        <p>Take one Coloquintida Apple, and divide it into four equal parts. Tie one part in a Bag, and boil it in Wine and Child's Urine, of each a Pint, adding a handful of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-ſuckles, till two thirds be conſumed. Inject it for a Clyſter.</p>
                        <p>Vomits and ſtrong Purges are more allowable in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of a Sciatica, than of the other ſorts. And in the progreſs of the Diſeaſe, Troches Alhandal, and ſweet Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, are ſafely given. As for external Remedies, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Cerecloth is equall'd by none.</p>
                        <pb n="480" facs="tcp:207638:241" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <p>Take of Pitch four Ounces, Turpentine half an Ounce; Maſtic, Amber, of each two Drams; Brimſtone in Pouder half an Ounce: make a Cerecloth.</p>
                        <p>I cured the Sciatica in a young Gentleman by this Method. He being plethoric, I firſt ordered a Vein to be opened; then I preſcribed thus:</p>
                        <p>Take of Diaphoretic Antimony, Chalybeat Bezoar, of each half a Scruple; Diaphoretic Gold five Grains: make a Pouder to be frequently repeated.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Waters of Mother of Thyme, of Mint and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Flowers, of each one Ounce; Spirit of Sal Armoniac a Dram and a half, prepar'd human Bones two Scruples, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoretic Antimony a Scruple, Laudanum Opiatum three Grains, Syrup of <hi>Carduus Benedictus</hi> ſix Drams. Mix, and give it by Spoonfuls.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Spirit of Sal Armoniac, Liquor of Hartſhorn with Amber, of each a Dram and a half: Mix and reſerve for uſe.</p>
                        <p>Externally I applied the above-mention'd Cerecloth for ſome days; then I order'd the part to be rubb'd and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the following Mixtures.</p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Aqua Articularis ad extra</hi> an Ounce and a half, Spirit of Salt Armoniac prepar'd with Quick-lime ſix Drams. Mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Aqua Articularis ad extra</hi> two Ounces, Spirit of Juniper-berries one Ounce, Balſam of <hi>Peru</hi> diſſolv'd with the Yelk of an Egg three Drams. Mix.</p>
                        <p>Cataplaſms of Antiſcorbutic Herbs boil'd in Wine, and bathing in Wine, or in the Decoction of Ants in Wine, are much commended.</p>
                        <p>If after the Paroxyſm there remain a Swelling, 'tis proper to fumigate the part with Wormwood, Rocket and Mug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, boil'd in Wine and Water, or to apply the <hi>Nurim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> Plaiſter. The Decoctions of Aromatic Vegetables in Wine are good for ſtrengthning the Joints. If there remain a Weakneſs in the Joints, without any Swelling, let Iſſues be cut in ſeveral parts of the Body: And indeed an Iſſue in the Groin is not improper.</p>
                        <p>Thus much for what is proper to be done in the Parox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yſms. It remains now briefly to point out the Method of preventing them. The vicious Acid muſt be carefully rooted out of the Stomac, by the uſe of Mercurial and Antimonial Preparations, and a regular Diet. Thoſe who are meagre, and can eaſily digeſt Milk, may confine themſelves to a Milk Diet.</p>
                        <pb n="481" facs="tcp:207638:241"/>
                        <p>Vomits are abſolutely neceſſary. Turbith Mineral, ſweet Mercury, black Hellebor and Coloquyntida, are much uſed. Gentle Purges, and ſuch as regard the Stomac, are beſt. Sweat ought to be frequently procur'd by the uſe of Diaphoretic Antimony, <hi>Antichecticum Poterii,</hi> Antimonial Sulphurs, and urinous Sudorifics. Next are Diuretics, which are of excellent uſe in preventing the Gout: As Spirit of Sal Armoniac, of Worms, of Hartſhorn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or the greazy Stagflies; or,</p>
                        <p>Take of prepar'd Crabs Eyes two Scruples, prepar'd red Coral a Scruple, Volatil Salt of Amber fifteen Grains: Mix for three Doſes.</p>
                        <p>As for Alteratives, Aromatic Volatil Medicines are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Roots of Elecampane, Pyony and Avens, of each ſix Drams; China Roots one Ounce; Of the Herbs, Sage, Baum, Germander, Ground-pine, of each a handful. Roſemary tops two handfuls, Juniper-berries an Ounce and a half; Galangal, Ginger, Cinnamon, of each two Drams; Salt of Tartar from three to four Drams. Tie them in a Bag to be infus'd in Wine. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Herbs Germander and Strawberry, of each a handful and a half; Reſt Harrow, Flowers of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Wort, of each a handful; Bryony Roots an Ounce and a half, Sarſaperilla one Ounce, Nephritic Wood three Ounces, freſh Juniper Berries half a Pound, Aromatic <hi>Coſtus</hi> three Drams; tie them in a Bag to be put into fermenting Ale.</p>
                        <p>A Salivation may be attempted before the Diſeaſe be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed; but afterwards 'tis dangerous.</p>
                        <p>'Tis uſual alſo to make Waſhes for the Feet. As, Take of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niper Berries half a Pound; of the Herb Roſemary ſix hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls; Mother of Thyme, and Marjoram or Sage, of each two handfuls. Boil them in Lees; and bathe the Feet at Night going to Bed.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THE Nerves of the Tongue terminat in a great many Glandules, diſpers'd along its Surface; which are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd with ſuch a peculiar Texture, as to be ſenſible of the various Impreſſions of the minuteſt ſaline Particles, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:207638:242"/>to their reſpective Circumſtances; in which conſiſts the ſenſe of <hi>Taſte.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Senſe is extinguiſh'd or render'd dull by the miſplac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Nerves of the Tongue, the relaxation of its Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres, ſharp Defluxions, or Paralytic and Apoplectic Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. 'Tis ſometimes vitiated, and counterfeits falſe Taſtes, by virtue of the Depravation of the Spittle; as in Scorbutic, Hypochondriac, and Catarrhous Caſes, or thoſe of a Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice or internal Ulcers. This Depravation is cur'd by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Vomit, drinking Whey with Juice of Citrons or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Spirits, and removing the principal Cauſe. In caſe of an Abolition or Flatneſs, Aromatic and Cephalic Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are proper. Horſe-Radiſh Roots chew'd in the mouth, or the Juice of Sorrel and Purſlain, us'd by way of Gargal, are of noted virtue for reſtoring the Taſte.</p>
                     <p>If the Muſcles of the Windpipe, or the recurrent Nerves are ſeiz'd with a Palſy or Convulſions, there inſues an <hi>Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> or want of Voice, which, if attended by a Hick-cough, is very dangerous.</p>
                     <p>In the Method of curing an <hi>Aphonia,</hi> the remote cauſes which occaſion the relaxation or contraction of the Muſcles or Nerves muſt be taken care of. Internally give the Spirit of Sal Armoniac, or of Hartſhorn with Caſtor or Amber. In an inveterat Palſy the Decoction of Sudorific Woods is very proper. Sometimes 'tis convenient to procure a Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by chewing.</p>
                     <p>For external Uſe, apply to the Neck a Bag of aromatic Ingredients ſprinkl'd with Spirit of Wine; or bathe it with the Eſſence of Caſtor, Spirit of Worms or of Ants, or the diſtill'd Oils of Amber, Lavender, Rue, Juniper, mix'd with Triacle, or Balſam of Peru. After a fit of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy give what follows.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Herbs Sage, and Roſemary, of each a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; Rocket-ſeeds two drams: boil them in a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of ſimple Water in a cloſe Veſſel. To a Pint of the ſtrain'd Liquor add Spirit of Black Cherries ſix Drams, Spirit of Sal armoniack a Dram; Hony of Roſemary Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers one Ounce: mix for a Gargal. 'Tis proper to open a Vein under the Tongue, if the Circumſtances of the Patient admit of it.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the Muſcles of the Windpipe are in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the Voice remains, but cannot be form'd into an articulat Sound or Speech, by reaſon of the Paralytic or Apoplectic Diſorders of the Tongue. In this caſe</p>
                     <pb n="483" facs="tcp:207638:242"/>
                     <p>Take of the Herbs, Roſemary, Marjoram, Sage, of each a handful; Roots of Pellitory of <hi>Spain,</hi> half an Ounce; Rocket-ſeeds or Muſtard-ſeeds, two or three Drams; Cloves a Dram; boil them in a cloſe Veſſel in Water. To a pint of the ſtrain'd Liquor, add Spirit of Juniper Berries, or of Black Cherries, from ſix Drams to an Ounce and a half; Spirit of Sal-armoniac prepar'd with Quick-lime, or with Cloves, from a Dram to a Dram and a half; Hony of Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Flowers, from ſix Drams to an Ounce: make a Gargal. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of Sage, Hyſſop, Acorus, of each a handful; boil them in Water. Strain the Liquor, and add an Ounce of Oxymel of Squills. Mix for a Gargal.</p>
                     <p>Take of Rocket-ſeeds, Squills, Onyons, Smallage, of each half a Dram; Ginger, Pepper, Cinnamom, and Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs, of each a Dram; Of the Pouders <hi>Diambra, Diamoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus dulcis,</hi> and <hi>Dianthos,</hi> of each two Scruples. With a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi> make a Mixture, and anoint the Tongue and Palat.</p>
                     <p>The Eſſence of Caſtor, or Caſtor it ſelf applied to the bridle of the Tongue, is very uſeful, eſpecially for the ſtut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of Children. The diſtill'd Oils of Cloves or Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeds, or Amber; the Cephalic Spirit of Vitriol, or Spirit of Black Cherries, or Spirit of Triacle with Camphyr, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are all very proper. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of Mithridat three Drams, Extract of Caſtor half a Dram; diſtill'd Oils of Lavender, Amber and Aniſeeds, of each four drops: mix, and rub the Tongue.</p>
                     <p>Take of Mithridat three ounces, candy'd Roots of Acorus an ounce; Ginger, Nutmegs, of each two drams; Volatil Salt of Amber a dram. Mix all together in a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and add of the Juice of Sage clarify'd an ounce, and ſcum'd Hony as much as ſufficeth, to make an Electua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which ſprinkle with diſtill'd Oil of Aniſeeds or Amber; rub the Tongue frequently with it, and lay about the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Nutmeg upon it, to be ſwallow'd down by degrees.</p>
                     <p>If old People are ſeiz'd with a difficulty of Speech, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit every Morning and Evening an ounce of the Eſſence of Lavender Flowers infus'd in Spirit of Wine.</p>
                     <p>A Cataplaſm of Lees with Amber or Oil of Amber, and other Cephalic Ingredients, may be applied to the top of the Head with good ſucceſs.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. V. <hi>Of the Diſorders of the ſenſe of Smelling.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE Organ of Smelling is the Membrane plac'd near to the <hi>ſieve-like</hi> Bone above the Noſtrils; which is variouſly affected by the different Textures of the ſulphurous Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that proceed from external Objects.</p>
                     <p>This Senſe is aboliſh'd or impair'd by the Apoplectic, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralytic, and Convulſive Diſorders of the Spirits, by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Paſſages, or Compreſſion of the nervous Filaments that reach to the Noſtrils; and by the relaxation of the Membrane; which may be occaſion'd internally by copious Defluxious, and externally by the forcible Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of odoriferous or ſneezing things. If it proceed from this laſt Cauſe, 'tis almoſt incurable.</p>
                     <p>As for the Cure. The Diſorders of the Spirits ought to be redreſs'd; the Defluxions prevented, and external offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Objects remov'd betimes. The Medicines that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for theſe different purpoſes are recounted elſewhere.</p>
                     <p>Marjoram and Fennel Flowers are two noted Specifics in this caſe. The Extract or Eſſence of Marjoram mix'd with the Oils or Eſſences of Penny Royal and Roſemary, may be taken inwardly from eight grains to half a ſcruple.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Oils of Fennel-flower, and of Orris, of each half a dram; diſtill'd Oil of Marjoram half a ſcruple. Apply it to the inner ſide of the Noſtrils; 'tis admirable in the caſe of an Obſtruction or Catarrh. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of Marjoram and Fennel-flower-ſeeds, each two drams: ſprinkle 'em with ſome drops of diſtill'd Oil of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joram or of Aniſeeds; and, according to Art, make a little Bag for the Noſtrils.</p>
                     <p>Take of Fennel-flower-ſeeds infus'd in ſtrong Vinegar, and afterwards dried, Rue, Fumitory and Caſtor, of each a dram; reduce them to a fine Pouder, and with Child's Urine beat it up into the form of a Syrup. Let the Patient ſnuff up five or ſix drops in the Morning faſting, leaning his head backwards, and holding warm Water in his mouth.</p>
                     <p>The Obſtruction of the Noſtrils may be caus'd by a <hi>Polypus,</hi> or fleſhy Excreſcency, that fills up the ſpace. Sometimes it riſes from the glandulous Membran at the top of the Noſtrils, but more frequently from the nervous Filaments in the ſieve-like Bone. Sometimes it deſcends to the inſide
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:207638:243"/>of the Mouth. Sometimes it has but one ſtalk, at other times more. Its Colour is white or red; if it be livid and painful, 'tis near akin to a Cancer.</p>
                     <p>It proceeds from the Corruption and Redundancy of the nutritious Juice, and the occaſional breach of the Unity of the Part. If it be white, ſoft, and painleſs, it is a good ſign. If 'tis deep rooted, and reaches to the nervous Filaments, 'tis dangerous.</p>
                     <p>The Cure is chiefly perform'd by external Applications: If the Body be diſorder'd, 'tis not improper to prepare it by internal evacuating and altering Medicines. The exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Remedies muſt be us'd in the laſt quarter of the Moon, becauſe the Swelling then decreaſes. The milder ſort are the juice of Pomegranats. Muſtard-ſeeds mix'd with Vinegar, the juice of <hi>Onopoſtus</hi> (a ſort of Thiſtle) the Pouder of Turnſole, the Juice of Watercreſſes, or the Juice of the roots of Aron; all which may be applied with Cotton to the part affected. The fiercer Remedies are ſublimate Mercury, Verdigreeſe and Lees; the Acid mineral Spirits, Aqua fortis, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Juice of Pomegranats three parts, Oil of Vitriol one part; mix. Or take of the Oil of Vitriol a ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, burnt Alum a dram, Plantain Water an ounce; mix, and ſprinkle the Polypus with it. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Cerecloth of Myrtles an ounce, of the Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment call'd <hi>Aegyptiacum</hi> two drams; mix for a Liniment: you may ſharpen it with precipitat Mercury frequently waſh'd. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Ointment <hi>Aegyptiacum.</hi> half an Ounce, the Rinds of Pomegranats and Galls, of each half a dram; Oil of Vitriol a ſcruple: Mix, and touch the Polypus with it every day.</p>
                     <p>In applying theſe Cauſtics, care muſt be taken that they touch not the neighbouring parts, by uſing a ſilver Fiſtula, or Cotton, or a Tent.</p>
                     <p>If a Polypus have any tendency to a Cancer, it ought not to be meddled with. If it be ulcerated, apply the Water or Aſhes of Frogs, Pouder of Crabs, Lead melted and dulcify'd, the <hi>Crocus</hi> of Steel, and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>If it only hang by one ſtalk, it may be cut off, or a thread of Silk well wax'd ty'd about the root. After 'tis taken off, the bleeding muſt be ſtopp'd by Aſtringents, and the Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Gentian with the Juice of Figwort applied on a Tent to the Noſtrils, in order to prevent its return.</p>
                     <pb n="486" facs="tcp:207638:244"/>
                     <p>The Smell may be adulterated by an Ulcer in the Noſtrils call'd <hi>Ozaena,</hi> which ſometimes ſeizes only the membranous ſoft parts, at other times the Cartilages and Bones. It may occaſion bleeding at the Noſe, or a plentiful Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſordid matter, or a Corruption of the adjacent parts, or a <hi>Polypus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The external Cauſes of an <hi>Ozaena</hi> are various; the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal for the moſt part is the Pox. It ought to be cautiouſly handled for fear of a Cancer: If it be inveterat, and affect the ſieve-like Bone, 'tis not eaſily cur'd.</p>
                     <p>The Ulcer may be cleans'd by ſnuffing up the Decoction of leſſer Centory, and Aromatic <hi>Calami<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s</hi> in Wine, till the patient be ſenſible of its falling into the Palat; or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joram Water with Hony, Myrrh, Sugar Candy, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Cinamon.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Ointment of Tobacco three drams, Balſam of Sulphur for external uſe a dram; mix, and apply to the Ulcer. The freſh Leaves of Tobacco may be put into the Noſe, and kept there ſome months, then taken out and anointed with this Balſam.</p>
                     <p>If there appear a Cruſt upon the Ulcer, it ought not to be remov'd by force; but by applying Oil of Sweet Almonds, or Oil of Roſes with freſh Butter: and then proceed to the cleanſing Remedies; among which Clary boil'd with Hony of Roſes is the moſt noted. The Decoction of Agrimony and Vervain in Hony, or Child's Urine, or the ſmoak of a red Wax-candle receiv'd at the Noſtrils, are proper for the ſame purpoſe. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of Marjoram and Plantain Water, of each an ounce and a half; rectify'd Spirit of Wine three drams, Hony of Roſes ſix drams: mix, and inject with a Syringe. If it do not yield to theſe Medicines, we muſt have recourſe to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial Preparations. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of Plantain Water four ounces, in which diſſolve of Sublimat Mercury twelve grains; ſtrain the Liquor, and apply it to the Ulcer.</p>
                     <p>Sweet Mercury well dulcify'd, or precipitat Mercury with Ointment of Roſes, or the Ointment <hi>Aegyptiacum</hi> may be applied with a Tent to the Ulcer; or Oil of Vitriol drop'd on a little Cotton may be applied twice or thrice, and then follow'd by proper Ointments.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THE Internal Senſes depend upon the various Motion and Agitation of the Spirits in the Brain. The Organs of External Senſe communicate the Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions they receive from Objects to the Original of the Nerves, where a Motion not unlike to their own inſues, and is called <hi>Common Senſe.</hi> This Motion in the Common Senſory is imparted to the Spirits in the <hi>Corpus Calloſum,</hi> where the <hi>Fancy</hi> reſides. The Spirits thus mov'd, roll to and again among the Nerves of the <hi>Cerebrum</hi> and <hi>Cerebellum;</hi> and their frequent returns thro the ſame Paſſages are chriſten'd, <hi>The Memory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Faculties are equally compatible to Men and Brutes, and are diſtinguiſh'd from thoſe of the rational Soul by their unacquaintedneſs with reflex Knowledg. If they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd, all the Functions and Motions of the Body ſuffer by it. The natural and involuntary Motion sof the nervous Fibres that ſurround the Stomach and Guts, depend upon the regular Recruits of Spirits convey'd thro the Nerves from the <hi>Cerebellum;</hi> and thoſe of the Muſcles which obey the command of our Wills, are owing to the due diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirits from the <hi>Cerebrum.</hi> This Motion of the Muſcles is perform'd by contraction. The Spirits croud into the Cavities of the Fibres, and by extending their width abridg their length, and in the interim the arterial Blood flows copiouſly into the middle of the muſculary Fibres, where it meets with leaſt reſiſtance. Thus the bloated Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle contracts it ſelf, and exchanges its <hi>Rhomboides</hi> Figure for a Rectangular Form.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THERE are ſeveral degrees obſervable in this Diſtemper: Sometimes there is only an apprehenſion that all things are carry'd round and toſs'd up and down; ſometimes 'tis attended by a dimneſs of the Eye-ſight, and a falſe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of various Colours; and ofttimes the Sight is quite loſt, and the Perſon falls down, which is moſtly follow'd by Convulſions and a tingling in the Ears.</p>
                     <p>The part affected is the Eye, where the Spirits wheel round, and make ſuch Impreſſions on the <hi>Retina,</hi> as exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal circular Motions are wont to produce. This proceeds from the irregular and confus'd Incurſions of the Spirits, and their impriſonment in the round Globe of the Eye. The dimneſs and loſs of Sight proceeds from the interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deficiency of Spirits; in which caſe their whole Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem is diſorder'd, and the other Senſes are brought into trouble.</p>
                     <p>If a Dizzineſs proceed originally from ſome diſorder in the Brain, 'tis call'd <hi>eſſential;</hi> but that rarely happens: For the moſt part 'tis a Symptom of other Diſeaſes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe of the Stomac: For the leaſt diſturbance of the Orifice of the Stomac do's quickly diſorder the Spirits in the Brain. Some ſtudious and hypochondriac Perſons are apt to be ſeiz'd with a ſwimming while their Stomac is empty, but by eating ward it off. Vomiting generally attends it: and drinking, eating of windy Meat, and ſulphurous Fumes offenſive to the Stomac, are apt to cauſe it. Old Men whoſe digeſtion is weak, hyſteric Women, and Perſons troubled with Worms in the Guts, or diſorders of the Spleen or Kidneys, are obnoxious to it: For the Contraction of the Membranes of thoſe parts is continu'd to the Brain; which reſembles the aſcending of Vapours, and ſo gives oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the vulgar Miſtake.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes a ſwimming may be caus'd by a redundancy of Blood, or by its vaporous halituous Diſpoſition, as in ſcorbutic and hypochondriac Caſes. If it proceed from an original Diſorder of the Brain, 'tis caus'd by external acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, or the acceſſion of heterogeneous Particles, or an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderat Conſumption of the Spirits.</p>
                     <pb n="489" facs="tcp:207638:245"/>
                     <p>A Symptomatical Dizzineſs is diſtinguiſh'd by the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Diſorders of other parts, and the apparent good order of the Brain. If it be inveterat, it portends an Apoplexy in old Perſons, and Convulſions in thoſe that are young. 'Tis more or leſs fear'd according to the height of its degrees. If it ſeize the hinder part of the head more than the fore part, 'tis more dangerous.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of preſervation takes place after the Paroxyſms, and is perform'd by Vomits and ſtomachic Medicines, when it owes its Original to the Stomac. If the Stomac be not faulty, gentle Purges may ſtand in the room of Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits. But fierce Purgatives ought always to be carefully avoided. Upon the whole, Dizzineſs and Convulſions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the ſame Remedies.</p>
                     <p>In the time of the Fit 'tis neceſſary to commence the Cure by a Vomit, by reaſon that for the moſt part it ariſes from the Diſorders of the Stomac; or at leaſt ſharp Clyſters muſt be injected.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Myſichcius</hi> his Emetic Tartar two grains, Sal armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac depurated nine grains: mix, and make a Pouder.</p>
                     <p>After vomiting, Take of the Pills of Maſtic a ſcruple, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of Agaric five grains, Scammony ſulphurated two grains, diſtill'd Oil of Amber two drops. With Eſſence of Amber make Pills. <hi>Crato</hi>'s Pills of Amber with Extract of Coloquintida, or the Pills call'd <hi>Aloephanginae,</hi> are likewiſe proper. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of ſweet Mercury fifteen grains, Scammony ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated three grains: make a Pouder.</p>
                     <p>If the ſwimming be inveterat, ſtrong or frequent Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives are improper. 'Tis ſufficient every New Moon or Full Moon to give at night a doſe of gentle looſening Pills, compos'd of Aloe, Gum Ammoniac, Myrrh, Maſtic, and the like.</p>
                     <p>Bloodletting is for the moſt part noxious: But in a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of a wonted Evacuation, or a Redundancy, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the Blood, 'tis not improper.</p>
                     <p>Sneezing Medicines ought to be carefully avoided. Iſſues and Bliſtering Plaiſters, are of excellent uſe for old Perſons, or Cacochymical Diſpoſitions. In a ſuppreſſion of the Piles, or diſorder of the Womb, the Legs are their proper Seat. When the Paroxyſm is over, the cure of preſervation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of Galangal half an ounce, Cubebs two drams, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar a dram and a half: make a Pouder; Doſe, two drams
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:207638:246"/>with Bisket dip'd in Wine an hour or two before Supper or Dinner. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of Piony Seeds, Coriander Seeds, Nutmegs, Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelto of the Oak, Cubebs, Galangal, of each two Drams; long Pepper, Ginger, Tormentil Roots, and Roſemary Leaves, of each a Dram. Make a Pouder; Doſe, half a Dram at pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Elixir Proprietatis</hi> with Spirit of Maſtic, or Elixir of Mint, or Galangal mix'd with Amber, are proper to this purpoſe. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Conſerves of Roſemary Flowers, of Sage, of Marjoram, of each half an Ounce; Ginger candi'd in the <hi>Indies,</hi> Nutmegs candi'd, of each three Drams; Rocket Seeds, Muſtard Seeds, of each a Dram and a half; prepar'd Amber two Drams; Cardamom, Cubebs, Galangal, of each a Scruple; volatil Salt of Amber half a Dram; Spirit of Black-cherries a Dram. With Syrup of Clove Gillyflowers, make an Electuary. Doſe, the bigneſs of a Nutmeg Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Evening. For old Perſons Confection-<hi>Alkermes</hi> may be added.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Conſerves of Mint, of Baum, of each half a Dram; Cinnabar of Antimony half a Scruple; diſtil'd Oils of Roſemary, of Amber, of each two Drops: with Syrup of Mint make a Bolus.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the proper Remedies for a ſymptomatical or leſs inveterat Giddineſs; but if it prove habitual, Specifics muſt be added. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Eſſences of Chervil, Sage, and common Baſil, of each a Dram; Caſtor a Dram and a half, Amber half a Dram. Doſe, forty or fifty Drops twice a day. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of Conſerve of Roſemary-flowers three Ounces, diſtill'd Oils of Boxwood (which is much eſteem'd) Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs and Mint, of each half a Dram: make an Electuary. Doſe half a Dram. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Juices of Wormwood, Horehound and Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas; Pouders of Maſtic, Rhubarb, Germander and Ground-Pine, of each three Drams; Hyſſop a Dram, Agaric two Ounces five Drams and a half: make an Electuary. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of Triacle of <hi>Andromachus,</hi> and Conſerve of Sage, of each one part; Conſerve of Roſes two parts. With Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of Roſemary-flowers, make an Electuary.</p>
                     <p>Peacocks Dung is a famous Specific. 'Tis often dry'd and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Pouder with Sugar, or infus'd in Wine, or any convenient Vehicle; or in the form of an Electuary with Conſerve of
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:207638:246"/>Roſemary Flowers. A compound Pouder may be preſcrib'd thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of Peacocks Dung three Ounces, Male Piony Roots an Ounce, Pouder of Cloves three Drams. Make a Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                     <p>The Brains of Sparrows are recommended by ſome. As, Take the Brains of fifty Sparrows; Veal Brains waſh'd in Wine, and dried in Smoak, Filberds, of each an Ounce; Mithridat three Drams. With Syrup of Citron Peel make an Electuary.</p>
                     <p>The Spirit of Hartſhorn prepar'd with Amber, Caſtor, and Spirit of Sal Armoniac aniſated, are mightily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd for this purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>In the mineral Province Cinnabar is a famous Specific. Let it be us'd thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of Peacocks Dung in Pouder three Drams, Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar of Antimony or native Cinnabar two Drams; Cubebs, Galangal, and volatil Salt of Amber, of each half a Dram: make a Pouder. Add as much of diſtill'd Oil of Aniſeeds mix'd with Sugar, as ſufficeth to render it grateful. Take now and then as much as will lie upon the Point of a Knife, or exhibit it in the following Mixture.</p>
                     <p>Take of Chervil-water three Ounces, Sage-water an Ounce and a half, Cinnamon-water ſix Drams; Spirit of Lilly Convally, and of Sage, of each three Drams: mix for the uſe above-mentioned. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of Chervil-water three Ounces, Spirit of Hartſhorn with Amber a Dram: mix.</p>
                     <p>Amber may be given inwardly, and its Oil applied to the Crown of the Head: Rock Oil may ſupply the want of Oil of Boxwood. As, Take of Conſerve of Mint an Ounce, Conſerve of Roſemary Flowers half an Ounce, white Rock Oil a Dram: with Syrup of Mint make an Electuary. If you pleaſe, you may add fifteen Grains of Salt of Amber. I have cur'd ſome with a Vomit and this Electuary alone.</p>
                     <p>In the laſt Extremity we have recourſe to Laudanum Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atum mix'd with Amber or volatil Medicines, which oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times proves more effectual than any other thing. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of Sage-water an Ounce and a half, Mint-water an Ounce, Spirit of Lilly Convally three Drams, Spirit of Sal Armoniac a Dram and a half, Laudanum Opiatum two or three Grains; Syrup of Orange Flowers three Drams: Mix. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of Black-cherry Water, Mint-water, and Lilly
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:207638:247"/>Convally Water prepar'd with Wine, of each an Ounce; Spirit of black Cherries three Drams; Eſſence of Caſtor a Dram and a half; Volatil Salt of Hartſhorn a Scruple; Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil Salt of Amber half a Scruple; Syrup of Clove Gilly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers half an Ounce. Mix; and give a ſpoonful or two in the Fit.</p>
                     <p>If the Diſeaſe be caus'd by the Diſorders of the Womb, Take of Swallow-water an Ounce and a half; Baum-water prepar'd with Wine an Ounce; Spirit of Lilly Convally, Spirit of black Cherries, of each a Dram; Spirit of Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac half a Dram; Volatil Salt of Amber fifteen Grains; Laudanum Opiatum two or three Grains, Syrup of Orange Peel half an Ounce. Mix, and uſe as above.</p>
                     <p>Eſſence of Caſtor, Spirit of Sal Armoniac, diſtill'd Oil of Amber, and in a word whatever is uſed in Epileptic Fits, may be applied to the Head, Temples, Noſtrils, Breaſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     </head>
                     <p>THE Inſtruments of all Motion are the Fibres, whether gathered into a Muſcie, or diſpers'd in a Membran. The Muſcles (for the moſt part) receive Spirits from the <hi>Cerebrum,</hi> and their regular Motions depend upon the Will. The other Fibres are ſupplied with Spirits from the <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> and perform involuntary Motions. If either the muſculary or membranous Fibres are preternaturally; mov'd, the former without the direction of the Will, or the latter with Violence and Pain; we call them <hi>Convulſive</hi> Motions. If the Part be contracted and remain immova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the ſame poſture, 'tis call'd <hi>Convulſio tonica,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into ſeveral ſorts. If the Head be drawn forwards towards the Breaſt, 'tis call'd <hi>Emproſthotonos.</hi> Vid. <hi>Hipoc. Sect.</hi> 4. <hi>Aph.</hi> 35. If backwards, <hi>Opiſthotonos:</hi> If it be ſtiff and immovable to either ſide, <hi>Tetanos.</hi> The Convulſions of the Yard in a <hi>Priapiſmus,</hi> of the Jaws in a Dog Cramp, of the Knees, Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are all included under this general. If the Contraction of the Part ceaſe and return alternatly, 'tis call'd a Concuſſion or <hi>Convulſio Clonica.</hi>

                        <head>ART. I. <hi>Of alternat Convulſions, and the Epilepſy or Falling-Sickneſs.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THE Epilepſy is an alternat Concuſſion of ſeveral Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Body, attended for the moſt part by a Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Senſe. It admits of three degrees. The firſt is not different from the third degree of a <hi>Vertigo;</hi> of which above. The ſecond is, when the whole Body is toſs'd with convulſive Motions, and the Senſes both internal and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, either remain in their wonted State, or become deliri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. The Perſon is taken with Laughter, Crying, Screek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Singing; beats his Breaſt, talks ridiculouſly, skips up and down the room, and performs a great many antic Actions: And when the Fit is over, is perfectly ignorant of all that paſs'd. Melancholy Perſons are obnoxious to it; and for them the Spirit of Hartſhorn prepar'd with Amber is a proper Cure. This kind of Epilepſies is very unfrequent. But the third ſort is very common, that is, when the Body is thrown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ground; all Reaſon and Senſe aboliſhed; the Thumbs ſhut cloſe within the Hands; the Feet tremble; the Arms toſs'd about; the Teeth gnaſh againſt one another, and bite the Tongue and Lips; Froth is caſt forth at the Mouth; and the whole Body is ſucceſſively lifted up and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. And when theſe Symptoms remit, the Perſon ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and groans; and when he comes to himſelf, complains of a Heavineſs of the Head, and a Wearineſs of the Joints, but remembers nothing that paſs'd.</p>
                        <p>The Part immediatly affected is the Fibres. If the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal muſculary Fibres are only affected, 'tis call'd an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Convulſion. If the Internal are ſeiz'd, 'tis call'd <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi> As in Nephritic, Colic, Hypochondriac and Hyſteric Fits, and the Pains of Women after Delivery. Theſe Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the internal Membrans are apt to cauſe Convulſions in the external Muſcles, by communicating their Diſorder to the Brain; and ſo produce an univerſal Epilepſy.</p>
                        <p>The immediat Cauſe is the rapid, unequal, and diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Motion of the Spirits; for the Spirits are equally the Cauſe both of natural and preternatural Motions. If the Sickneſs be inveterat or hereditary, perhaps the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are degenerat from their natural Conſtitution, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more elaſtic and moveable.</p>
                        <pb n="494" facs="tcp:207638:248"/>
                        <p>The remote Cauſes are, the Irritation of any ſenſible part, as the puncture of a Nerve; the Collection of heterogeneous Particles in the Brain, or their mixture with the Spirits; as in Wounds of the Head, malignant Feavers, and the Ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any wonted Evacuation of Blood. Sometimes the vicious Recrements of the Blood are convey'd to the Brain with the Lympha, and infect the Spirits, or mix with them; and ſometimes are lodg'd in other parts. Theſe noxious Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles are nitroſulphureous, and in ſome meaſure Elaſtic, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Willis;</hi> and the nature of the Remedies uſed againſt them ſufficiently proves them to be acid. Upon which account 'tis that Scorbutic, Hypochondriac and Hyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric Perſons are moſt liable to Convulſions: for the peccant Acid infinuats it ſelf into the fibrous and tendinous Parts of the Muſcles, and renders them ſtiff and unwieldy. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, ſuppoſing it did not lodg in the Muſcle, it affects the Nerves where-ever 'tis, and depraves the chylous Juice of the Glandules, eſpecially thoſe of the Meſentery, where it often lurks. This Acid is for the moſt part bred in the Stomac or firſt ways, and frequently produces Convulſions in gouty and arthritic Conſtitutions.</p>
                        <p>If the Brain or what it contains be immediatly affected without the intervening of any other part, 'tis call'd an <hi>eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> Convulſion. But if another part be firſt affected, 'tis <hi>Sympathical;</hi> as when Convulſions are caus'd by Worms, by the Diſorders of the lower Belly, Ulcers or Aches of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Parts, by the ſuppreſſion of the Terms or Piles; neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of Venery, cauſing a Corruption of the ſeminal Liquor in Women; the Indiſpoſition of the Stomac, the Diſorders of the Kidneys, Bladder, and Meſentery; Arthritic, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy and cholic Fits; Pains of Childbirth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When a Convulſion proceeds from any inferior part, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles the Motion of a cold Vapor riſing from the part to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Brain. But there is neither ſpace for that Vapor to move in, nor a ſufficient force to put it in Motion: Therefore 'tis a falſe Imagination, and ought to be rectified. The plain caſe ſtands thus. The Part being irritated by the offending Cauſe, the Spirits repair in a diſorderly manner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and contract the Fibres; theſe Spirits are follow'd by large Numbers of others, that not finding room in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted part, rebound; this Convulſion is continued to the Original of the Nerve, and creates a Diſorder in the Brain, which affects all the other Nerves, and produces the univerſal Epilepſy. So the gradual Contraction of the Part,
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:207638:248"/>and the diſorderly Incurſions of the Spirits, create a Senſe not unlike to that of aſcending Vapors, and occaſion the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Error. Theſe imaginary Vapors are generally attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſenſe of Cold, by reaſon that the Spirits have not a free admiſſion into the contracted part.</p>
                        <p>Convulſions differ from Trembling in this, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer invade the part when reſting; whereas the other fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows only upon attempting ſome voluntary motion. In a Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy the Part affected may be mov'd or extended without Pain, but in a Convulſion it cannot. In Swoonings or ſleepy Diſeaſes the Pulſe is weak and low, and the Fits obſerve no regular Periods, nor are they eaſily carried off; but in the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of an Epilepſy, tho it reſemble ſwooning, the Pulſe is ſtrong and frequent, and the Fit returning at ſet times is eaſily cured.</p>
                        <p>In acute burning Feavers, Convulſions are foretold from a tingling in the Ears, heavineſs of the Head, dulneſs of the Senſes, panting of the Heart, Flaſhings of Light, and ſtrange Colors appearing before the Eyes. If in the beginning of the Diſeaſe, the Balls of the Eyes are ſeiz'd with Pain, without any Inflammation; or if the ſick Perſon attempt as it were to catch Flies, it betokens a <hi>Delirium,</hi> and Convulſions. But if he begin to pick at the Bedclothes, or be ſenſible of the Contraction or twitching of any Member, or of the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Aſcent of Vapors to the Head, the Convulſion is juſt at hand.</p>
                        <p>If the Patient dote, and be uncapable to give an account of theſe Symptoms, the Phyſician may put his hand to the Wriſts or tendinous Parts; and if he obſerve that the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons ſtart or quaver, 'tis a ſign of fatal Convulſions. An Epilepſy may be alſo propheſy'd in other caſes from fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Swimmings of the Head, and Nightmares.</p>
                        <p>If an Epilepſy proceed from Convulſions of the internal Membrans, it diſcovers it ſelf by a murmuring Noiſe in the Guts, Swellings or Contractions or Hardneſs of the Belly, drawing the Navel inwards, violent throws in the Guts, Pains in the Loins, a Diſtention and Contraction of the Breaſt, difficulty of Breathing, an apprehenſion of being ſtifled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If it be <hi>eſſential,</hi> it ſurpriſes the Perſon without any preceding ſigns, or ſenſe of Pain; but a <hi>ſymptomatical</hi> Epilepſy is uſher'd in by the aching of ſome affected part, and the apprehenſion of Vapors tranſmitted from thence to the Brain.</p>
                        <p>The Prognoſtics are variable according to the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:207638:249"/>of the Patient. If an Epilepſy commence after the twenty fifth year of the Perſons Age; if it ſucceed Iliac Pains, acute Feavers, immoderat Watchings, exceſſive loſs of Blood, over-violent Purging, or the uſe of Hellebor; if the Fits return frequently, and the Lips, Tongue, Eyelids, or Breaſt, be much affected; if the Diſeaſe be hereditary, eſſential, and inveterat; if the Patient do's not ſneeze after uſing Medicines for that purpoſe: In all theſe caſes there's a great deal of danger. If a Woman with Child be ſeiz'd with Convulſions, they threaten Miſcarriage. If it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence from the Infancy, or before the ſtate of Manhood, 'tis curable. If it return frequently, it renders the Perſon ſtupid or delirious. If a Chronical Epilepſy be follow'd by an unmalignant Feaver, 'tis a good Omen.</p>
                        <p>The Cure of Convulſions and the Falling Sickneſs of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is accounted for elſewhere. As for adult Perſons, the Phyſician muſt heedfully inform himſelf if the Cauſe be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal or internal; if the Diſeaſe be <hi>eſſential</hi> or <hi>ſymptomati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal;</hi> and if ſymptomatical, in what particular Member the ſource of the Diſtemper lies. And withal let him careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerve the following Remarks, which do not relate to the Paroxyſm, but the general method of Cure.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That Chronical Convulſions ariſing from internal Cauſes, do generally invade Hypochrondiac and Scorbutic Perſons, and are owing to a vicious Acid, which for the moſt part is bred in the firſt Paſſages. Therefore Evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the uſe of teſtaceous Alcalin Pouders, Spaniſh Soap boil'd in Milk, and Chalybeat Medicines, are recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That if the Diſeaſe ariſe from any particular Member, the Medicines which properly regard that part ought to be join'd with Specifics; but not exhibited till after the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Evacuations.</p>

That if the Diſtemper proceed from the Diſorders of any external part, 'tis proper to place a Ligature betwixt it and the Brain, juſt before the Invaſion of the Paroxyſm.

                        <p>The true Cure of this Diſeaſe conſiſts in preſervation, and preventing the Paroxyſm. Vomits are the firſt in order. Next are purging Medicines, which ought to be ſtrongeſt in an eſſential Epilepſy.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Extract of black Hellebor, ſweet Mercury right prepar'd, of each fifteen Grains; Extract of Troches Alhandal one or two Grains, diſtill'd Oil of Amber two Drops: with Eſſence of Myrrh, or of Caſtor, make Pills. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of ſweet Mercury fifteen Grains, Scammony pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with Sulphur four or five Grains. Make a Pouder. Or,</p>
                        <pb n="498" facs="tcp:207638:250"/>
                        <p>Take of the Conſerve of Roſemary-flowers a Dram, Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Jalap half a Scruple, ſweet Mercury fifteen Grains: with the Syrup of Apples make a Bolus.</p>
                        <p>Sweet Mercury and <hi>Mercurius vitae,</hi> well pounded and exactly mix'd, prove laxative, and are mighty uſeful in this caſe.</p>
                        <p>The Specifics for this Diſeaſe are very numerous; I ſhall briefly recount thoſe that are moſt univerſally receiv'd.</p>
                        <p>In the vegetable Province Male Piony is a famous Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic, if gather'd in its proper ſeaſon; the neglect of which has abridg'd its Reputation. It ought to be gather'd at Noonday in <hi>July</hi> or <hi>Auguſt;</hi> or before the Sun riſing, when both the Sun and Moon are in <hi>Aries,</hi> during the wain of the Moon. It is both given inwardly, and ty'd about the Neck, with good Succeſs.</p>
                        <p>Next are the Flowers of Lilly of the Valley. They ought to be gather'd before the riſing of the Sun, while they are wet with the Dew, and preſently diſtill'd with Spaniſh Wine; which may be diſtill'd again ſeveral times upon freſh Flowers. If you infuſe Caſtor in this Spirit, it extracts a noble Eſſence, which may be given from half a Dram to a Dram.</p>
                        <p>Hazelwood yields an excellent Spirit and Oil. The Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelto of this Tree, and the Catkins that grow upon it, are endow'd with an Anodyn Sulphur, and are very ſucceſsful Specifics againſt this Diſeaſe. The Miſſelto ought to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd in the wain of the Moon in <hi>March,</hi> and may be given from half a Dram to a Dram. Miſſelto of the Oak is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe uſeful. But while they are us'd, 'tis needful to purge now and then, leſt their fixing Quality ſhould occaſion other Diſeaſes. In the Spring we gather a Sulphur from the Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins of Hazel, that may be given inwardly from a Scruple to a Dram.</p>
                        <p>The Miſſelto and Flowers of the Limetree, Boxwood, Lavender Flowers, Flowers of Dill, Angelica and Valerian Roots, Roots of Swallowort, Acorus, Briony, Seeds of Soapwort and Rue, are much eſteem'd. Black-cherries, <hi>Aſſa faetida,</hi> Camphyr, Spirit of Soot, Extract and Eſſence of the Wood of Aloe, are likewiſe Specifics. Some commend the Coals dig'd from under Mugwort, which <hi>Deckers</hi> takes to be the antient Roots of Mugwort, reſembling Coals.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are the moſt noted vegetable Specifics, to which we generally add Cephalic and Aromatic Medicines. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Leaves and Flowers of Sage ſix Ounces,
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:207638:250"/>Flowers of Lilly of the Valley three Ounces, Flowers of ſweet Lavender an Ounce, Male Piony Roots two Ounces, Leaves and Flowers of Marjoram half an Ounce, choice Cinnamom two Ounces, Cubebs half an Ounce, Cloves three Drams, Mace two Drams; infuſe them in fourteen Pound of Rheniſh or Spaniſh Wine. Let them macerat for fourteen days; then diſtil in a <hi>Balneum Mariae.</hi> You may add Caſtor, and Spirit of Sal Armoniac.</p>
                        <p>In the Animal Province, the Spirit, Oil, and volatil Salt of human Blood taken from a beheaded Criminal, are ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Specifics. The Spirit of a human After-birth pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified, given from fifteen to forty Drops, is reſerv'd by ſome for a Secret: Or the Pouder of it dried in an Oven may be given from half a Dram to a Dram. The Skull of one that dies a violent Death, may be given in Pouder from a Scruple to a Dram. It yields a Spirit and volatil Salt, of wonderful uſe; and its Oil when rectify'd and applied to the Crown of the Head, prevents the Epileptic Fit. Oil of Amber diſtill'd with the Pouder of Man's Soul, yields a moſt penetrating Oil for the ſame uſe. The human Brain, its Spirit and Oil, and Bones of Men, are likewiſe much eſteem'd.</p>
                        <p>The Bones of other Animals, eſpecially the Teeth of a Sea-horſe, the Livers of green Frogs, the Liver of a Wolf, the Gall of a black Cat, the Spirit of Urine, the Blood of a hunted Hare, Caſtor, together with Spirits and volatil Salts, are much in uſe. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of volatil Salt of Amber, volatil Salt of a human Skull, of each a Scruple; Caſtor two Drams: Infuſe in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine; let them digeſt and circulat; and they yield an admirable Tincture againſt this Diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>Peacocks Dung, Quails Eggs, Spirit of Sal Armoniac pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with Quick-lime, Spirit of Tartar, <hi>Aſſa faetida,</hi> Elks Claws, Swallows, with the Spirits and volatil Salts, are common Specifics.</p>
                        <p>In the mineral Family: The fix'd Sulphurs of Antimony lead the Van. Cinnabar of Antimony, ſublimated ſeveral times, and reduc'd to a fine Pouder, with ſome ſpirituous Water, is given in Subſtance; or a Tincture may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from it with ſome vegetable Spirit, that is of ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Virtue in this caſe. Or the Cinnabar may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd in a <hi>Menſtruum</hi> prepar'd from Nitre and Sal-Gem; and precipitated into Cryſtals, which paſs by the name of <hi>Aſtrum Mercurii Secretum.</hi> Native Hungarian Cin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>abar is
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:207638:251"/>likewiſe very uſeful. But above all, the Sulphur taken from the Droſs of the <hi>Regulus</hi> of Antimony, after this manner. After you have ſeparated the <hi>Sulphur Auratum</hi> by a ſecond Precipitation, take the ſame ſtrain'd Liquor, and pour on ſome diſtill'd Vinegar and Spirit of Urine: It precipitates a noble Sulphur of incomparable uſe againſt an Epilepſy. Three Grains may be given to adult Perſons.</p>
                        <p>Next to the fix'd Sulphurs of Antimony is Vitriol. Its fix'd Anodyn Sulphur, and its ſulphureous volatil Spirit right prepar'd, are mightily applauded by <hi>Helmont</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſus.</hi> The common Spirit of Vitriol is corroſive, not volatil; but the true volatil Spirit is drawn from Vitriol expos'd to the Air, and the preceding Phlegm is chamfer'd. The Spirit drawn from Vitriol and human Urine is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Medicine; for the Alcali of the Urine diſſolves the Metallin Sulphur, and the Spirit renders it volatil. In like manner any other vegetable Spirit, mix'd with Vitriol, yields a cephalic Spirit of Vitriol, which may be mix'd with Spirit of human Blood, and exhibited in an hereditary Epilepſy.</p>
                        <p>Amber concludes the mineral Catalogue. It yields a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, volatil Salt and Oil, which may be mix'd with Spirit of Hartſhorn, or of human Blood. Sometimes Camphyr may be added; which is a noted Pacific, and of ſingular uſe, together with Opium, againſt the Epilepſies ariſing from the Womb.</p>
                        <p>The Methods of preſcribing theſe Specifics are as follows.</p>
                        <p>Take of Black-cherry-water, Lilly Convally-water, and <hi>Langius</hi>'s Epileptic Water, of each one Ounce; Spirit of Hartſhorn <hi>ſuccinated,</hi> or rectify'd Spirit of a human Skull, a Dram, Syrup of Clove Gilly flowers an Ounce. Mix. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Water of Lime-tree-flowers, Sage-water, Black-cherry Water, of each an Ounce; Spirit of Hartſhorn with Amber three Drams, Spirit of Triacle camphoriz'd, or Eſſence of Caſtor a Dram; Eſſence of Opium a Scruple, Syrup of Piony Flowers an Ounce. Mix, and give two or three Spoonfuls twice or thrice a day.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Water of the new Horns of a Hart two Ounces, Spirit of human Brains an Ounce, Spirit of human Blood a Dram and a half, prepar'd human Skull a Dram, volatil Salt of human Skull fifteen Grains, volatil Salt of Amber half a Scruple, Laudanum Opiatum three or five Grains, Syrup of Arabian Stechas an Ounce.

                        <p>Take of Baum-water two Ounces, Sage-water an Ounce, Eſſence of Caſtor two Drams, Spirit of Hartſhorn with Oil of Amber a Dram, Syrup of Piony Flowers half an Ounce: mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As for Pouders. Take of Cinnabar of Antimony half a Dram, volatil Salt of Amber twelve Grains; Laudanum Opiatum prepar'd by Fermentation, two or three Grains: make a Pouder for two Doſes. For a Vehicle,</p>

                        <p>Thus far I have conſider'd the Method of preſerving from, or preventing Epileptic Fits: My next buſineſs is to ſhew what ought to be done during the time of the Fits. If the Perſon be Plethoric, let blood; but take care to draw forth but a ſmall quantity. Then give a ſtrong Emetic. If the temporal Muſcles, or thoſe of the Gullet, are ſo affected that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon cannot open his mouth or take down any thing, you muſt open the mouth with a Spoon, and throw it in; or wet a Feather with the Emetic Syrup, and a Grain or two of <hi>Mercurius Vitae,</hi> and thruſt it into the Throat.</p>
                        <p>If a Vomit cannot conveniently be given, inject frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſharp Clyſters, adding to them antimonial Infuſions and volatil ſpecific Salts.</p>
                        <p>Sneezing Pouders ought to be cautiouſly us'd during the Fit, for they cauſe Convulſions. In room of them put Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Sal armoniac, or of Urine to the Noſtrils; or drop it upon the Tongue. The ſmell of Amber thrown upon the Coals is very effectual. The external Parts may be rub'd, but withal very gently. If the Epilepſy proceed from any external Part, Ligatures are very proper. The Backbone may be anointed with ſpecific Oils or Liniments. In the mean while 'tis not improper to throw into the mouth two or three ſpoonfuls of ſome Epileptic Mixture, as above-preſcribed.</p>
                        <p>If the Tongue be hurt by the Teeth, throw upon it the Pouder of Crabs-eyes, or anoint it with ſome vulnerary Extract and Sugar.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>TRembling reſembles Convulſive Motions, and when it follows Epileptic Fits, partakes of their Nature. Some particular Members are apt to ſhake after drinking or ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Paſſion; but this is a leſſer ſort of trembling: For ſome are univerſal, ſome particular; ſome greater, and ſome leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer. It do's not proceed from any weakneſs of the moving Faculty, but from the joint Action of ſeveral Muſcles that are either Antagoniſts, or imploy'd in different Motions of the Member, which is occaſion'd by the almoſt equal Incurſions of the Animal Spirits: whereas upon the Will's injoining a particular Motion, they ought to repair more copiouſly to the Muſcle, whoſe Office 'tis to perform the commanded Motion;
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:207638:254"/>than into its other Companions that are ſuppoſed to reſt.</p>
                        <p>The Animal Spirits are apt to commit this Error, when diſorder'd by Paſſion, or over-fix'd by the uſe of Narcotics, or exceſſive drinking of Wine. But oft-times the Spirits themſelves are innocent, and the fault lies either in the Nerve or the Muſcle. If any Obſtruction or Irritation happen at the head of the Nerve, the Spirits deſign'd for the Muſcle are diverted another way. If the Fibres of the Muſcle be contracted, dry, miſplac'd, or not ſo acceſſible as they ought to be, the regular <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>rrival of the Spirits is prevented.</p>
                        <p>Thus mercurial Steams, immoderat Venery, Cold, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of cold Liquors, ſuppreſſion of wonted Evacuations, and malignant Feavers, are wont to occaſion a Trembling.</p>
                        <p>Trembling is eaſily diſtinguiſh'd from a Palſy, by the performance of the voluntary motion; and from Convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by this, that it never appears but when a voluntary motion is attempted.</p>
                        <p>If it ſucceed to a Palſy, it prognoſticats a Recovery. If it proceed from internal Cauſes, it ought not to be neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If it be hereditary, of a long ſtanding, or accompany'd by old Age, it ſeldom admits of a Cure. If it terminat in Convulſions, or approach to their Nature; If attended by Doating in Burning Feavers; If it ſucceed to Child-birth, or happen in a Lethargy or Apoplexy; it portends ill. If the under-lip quaver, it betokens Vomiting.</p>
                        <p>The occaſional Cauſe muſt be diligently inquir'd for, and remov'd. So the method of Cure muſt be calculated for the various Cauſes. In general, it requires cephalic and nervous Medicines, ſuch as are us'd againſt Palſies, Convulſions, and Apoplexies. Sage is a noted Specific in this caſe; it may be eaten with food, infus'd in Ale; or a Spirit or Eſſence taken from it, and mix'd with Caſtor, which may be us'd inwardly often. The Hands or Part affected may be fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with this Spirit, or an infuſion of Sage in Wine or Water us'd for a waſh. Baum is next; its Leaves infus'd in Wine, or Spirit of Wine, make a uſeful Medicine for this purpoſe. Juniper-berries, their Spirit, Oil, Rob, Infuſion in Wine or Spirit of Wine, and the infus'd Berries in ſubſtance, are very ſovereign in this caſe. After due Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations, there is nothing ſo proper as a Diet-drink of the Decoction of Woods, eſpecially of Juniper Wood.</p>

                        <p>Peacocks Dung infus'd in Spirit of Wine is a ſovereign Remedy againſt Trembling in old Age. The Oils of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zelwood and Boxwood are alſo very proper.</p>
                        <p>If it proceed from metallin or mercurial Fumes, Cinnabar of Antimony and antimonial Sulphurs ought to be mix'd with human Bones, and exhibited in order to procure Sweat. The Decoction of Elecampane and Fennel Roots in Wine, taken Morning and Evening, the Perſon being cover'd in order to ſweat, is famous for expelling and correcting Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury in the Body. Leaves of Gold, or Medicines parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Gold, are proper in this caſe to be given inwardly; and an Ointment of Gold may be applied outwardly.</p>
                        <p>As for external Remedies, <hi>Foreſtus</hi> recommends rubbing and waſhing the Part with freſh Urine. In room of which you may uſe what follows.</p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Aqua Articularis</hi> for external uſe three or four Ounces, Spirit of Earth-worms an Ounce and a half, Spirit of Ants ſix or eight Drams, Eſſence of Caſtor three or four Drams: mix, and bathe the part affected.</p>

                           <hi>Petrus à Caſtro</hi> orders the part to be frequently fomented with diſtill'd Water of Nettles. The Leaves of an Aſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd in Lees are commended.

                        </head>
                        <p>WHEN Perſons are ſeiz'd with Apoplexies, they are like dead People in every reſpect, except the beating of their Pulſe, Breathing, and the color of their faces. If the Reſpiration be much impair'd, the Pulſe very low, and ſcarce perceptible, and the Perſon ſnort, and froth at the Mouth, 'tis a violent Fit. If the whole Body be equally ſeiz'd, 'tis an univerſal Apoplexy. If only one ſide of the Head and Body, or the Trunk of the Body alone, or a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular part by it ſelf, be affected while the others are at eaſe, 'tis call'd a particular Apoplexy. 'Tis uſual among Writers to refer the Apoplexies of particular Parts to Palſies; but
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:207638:255"/>indeed theſe Diſorders of particular Members proceeding from internal Cauſes, and call'd by them Paralytic, were by the Antients accounted ſlight Apoplexies. <hi>Vid. Hip. Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>Aph.</hi> 42.</p>
                        <p>The Cauſe of Apoplexies may be deriv'd from the failure of the motion of the Animal Spirits, either in the <hi>Cerebrum</hi> or <hi>Cerebellum.</hi> If in the latter, the Circulation of the Blood and Motion of the Heart are in a manner quite extinguiſh'd. If the Animal Spirits be hindred to viſit the Heart by the Convulſion of its Nerves, or ſuch other Cauſes, the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect will follow. Theſe Cauſes are call'd <hi>Privative,</hi> which do not affect the Spirits immediatly, but only prevent their Excurſions, or withdraw the matter of their Generation, as all Obſtructions of the Brain, a Fall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The poſitive Cauſes are ſuch as ſtupify the Spirits, or render 'em unfit for performing their Office, as narcotic Medicines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A privative Apoplexy is occaſion'd by ſtopping the Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Blood. This is caus'd either by an Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Brain impriſoning the Spirits; or by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, tearing or breaking of the Blood-veſſels. As, when external Violence is us'd, an Apoplexy may be caus'd by the Ligature or Compreſſion of the Carotid Arteries, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the interruption of the Blood in its Paſſage to the Brain. This <hi>Hippocrates</hi> underſtood by his <hi>Obſtructio Venae,</hi> it being cuſtomary among the Antients to ſignify by Veins the Arteries and Nerves. The other privative Apoplexies proceeding from internal Cauſes, are rather owing to the ſtoppage of the Blood in the Veins, and its ſubſequent Stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in, or Diſtention of the Brain; for ſuppoſe one of the Carotid Arteries were ſtraiten'd by ſome internal Cauſe, the other Artery communicating with it, would ſupply the Brain with Blood, and ſo no Apoplexy would inſue upon that occaſion. 'Tis the hindrance therefore of the Reflux of the Blood, and its ſubſequent Stagnation, that in internal caſes diſtends the Brain, ſtraitens its Paſſages, extinguiſhes the motion of the Animal Spirits, and ſo cauſes the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes the Blood is ſo thick and congeal'd, that of it ſelf it ſtops in the Veſſels within the Brain, without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination to that effect from the Blood Veſſels; as in <hi>Heart-ſwooning,</hi> which is a caſe not only parallel, but near a kin to this, it ſtagnates in the Lungs.</p>
                        <p>The Antients deriv'd the cauſe of an Apoplexy from a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Serum in the Ventricles of the Brain; but Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:207638:255"/>Diſſections make it appear, that the Brains of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plectic Perſons are not always moleſted with any ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and that ſeveral People are, who were never ſeiz'd with an Apoplexy in their Lives. It remains therefore to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that the immediat Cauſe of all Apoplexies is the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolition either of the motion of the animal Spirits, or of the Circulation of the Blood.</p>
                        <p>The remote Cauſes with reference to a defective Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood, are, ſudden Cold, exceſſive Heat, gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandizing in a ſedentary way of Living; waſhing the Head with warm Water, and then expoſing it to the Cold; Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in the Scull; ſuppreſſion of wonted Evacuations of Blood; uſing Dragons Blood after violent Purges; immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat Venery, eſpecially in old Age; Anger, and all turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Paſſions of the Mind.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the motion of the animal Spirits, the remote Cauſes of Apoplexies are a Contuſion or violent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of the Brain, by Thunder, Cannon ſhooting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> any ſudden and impetuous Force that drives inwards the Lymph which waters the Cortical part of the Brain; Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtumes or any vitious matter lodg'd in the Head; all which ſtraiten the Paſſages of the Brain, and Original of the Nerves, and ſo cramp the Spirits that they cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their wonted Office.</p>
                        <p>Exceſſive Drinking may occaſion a Prevalency or Redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy of Serum in the Brain, that preſſes down the Walls of the Paſſages. Accordingly we ſometimes meet with great quantities of Serum in diſſecting the Heads of ſuch as die of Apoplexies. The Small-pox or Scab ſtruck inwards, and ſeveral other Cauſes, may likewiſe produce the ſame effect. Upon this account I ſhall not ſcruple to admit the diſtinction of privative Apoplexies into ſuch as are Sanguin, and thoſe which are Serous; tho a nice Theoriſt might cavil againſt it. The former kind is apt to invade thoſe whoſe Blood is thick and prone to congeal; the latter for moſt part ſeizes old de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit Catarrhous Conſtitutions.</p>
                        <p>Mercurial and ſubterranean Vapors not only clog the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, but thicken the Blood, and ſo cauſe a privative Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy. As for poſitive Apoplexies caus'd by an immediat Depravation and Fixation of the Spirits, I am of <hi>Helmont</hi>'s Opinion, that not only external things, but an internal Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment bred in the Stomac oft-times cauſes 'em. This I am induc'd to believe by theſe Conſiderations.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Vomits, ſharp Clyſters and ſtomachic Medicines are
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:207638:256"/>ſovereign Remedies againſt a poſitive Apoplexy; which is a ſign that the Stomac is concern'd. 2. The Steams of Coals, Smoak of Tobacco, and eating ungrateful Food, cauſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexies. Now undoubtedly theſe affect the mouth of the Stomac moſt immediatly. 3. I remember an inſtance of a Woman that was ſeiz'd with a poſitive Apoplexy, of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, without any known Cauſe: her Spirits were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted or deficient, but ſhe had an invincible Propenſity to Sleep, with a grievous Anxiety and Trouble in her Breaſt; and after Recovery happening to take a Vomit upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion, was thrown into the ſame Symptoms again. Now, as I take it, the ſource of the Diſeaſe lay in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac, and the Vomit waken'd it afreſh. 4. A Giddineſs proceeding from the Stomac is frequently a Fore-runner of an Apoplexy; and where this is hereditary to a Family, that is a ſure ground of Prediction. 5. <hi>Poterius</hi> his Diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retic Gold and Cinnabar of Antimony are Specifics againſt Apoplexies. Now they do not poſitively reach further than the firſt Paſſages. 6. The ſudden and ſurprizing way of Invaſion of ſome Apoplexies, ſeems to intimate that there is a virulent Ferment in the Body which immediatly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes or fetters the Spirits.</p>
                        <p>Suppoſing therefore that there is a virulent Ferment bred in the Stomac, we can give no other account of its manner of Operation than this, that as Opium in the Stomac diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the Spirits to Sleep, ſo it fixes 'em to an Apoplectic height.</p>
                        <p>When an univerſal Apoplexy terminates in a particular one, if it be ſanguin, I doubt 'tis uncurable, unleſs it yield to Blood-letting. Or perhaps the clotted Blood may have left ſome Serum in the Brain, which falls deeper upon the ſpinal Marrow, or is thrown upon ſome particular Nerves; or if the Apoplexy was originally Lymphatic, the Lymph may have ſunk in, and ſo caus'd an Obſtruction of ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Nerves. This Solution will ſerve for privative Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexies; but as touching the poſitive, I am at a loſs to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance any plauſible Reaſon, unleſs you admit of this, that the Contraction of the upper Extremity of the Nerves, near to their original Inſertion, may produce a mere Apoplexy, without Convulſions, which always inſue the Contraction of their outward Parts.</p>
                        <p>The Signs and Prognoſtics of an Apoplexy are theſe: The Perſon is ſeiz'd with a profound Sleep, depriv'd of all Senſe and Motion; the Reſpiration remains intire more or
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:207638:256"/>leſs, according to the violence of the Fit. If the Patient froth at the Mouth, the Reſpiration is e'en almoſt aboliſh'd; for the Froth is the Blood ſtagnating in the Lungs, impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated and rarify'd by Air, and ſo thrown up. This is a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Sign according to <hi>Hipp. Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>Aph.</hi> 43. for all that die of Apoplexies, are actually ſtifled. But we ought care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to diſtinguiſh this Froth of Blood, which is of a whitiſh red Color, and caſt up from the bottom of the Breaſt, from the thin Spittle-like Froth, caus'd in the Palat by the Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Air in a viſcid Humor. If the Apoplexy proceed from a Stagnation of the Blood, the Face and Eyes are bloated, and of a red Color, and the Body is hot; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they are pale and cold. If the Perſon ſnort high, 'tis an ill Omen. If the Memory decay of a ſudden, 'tis a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of an Apoplexy. Sometimes the Urine and Excrements are voided without the Perſon's ſenſe, by reaſon of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation of the Sphincters.</p>
                        <p>A poſitive Apoplexy is diſtinguiſh'd from a privative by the Conſtitution of the Patient, of which above; and the Anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties of the Breaſt attending the former. An Apoplexy is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd from a <hi>Syncope Cardiaca,</hi> or Heart-ſwooning, by this, that the latter is not attended by Snorting; the Reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in it is always extremely difficult, and the Breaſt mightily troubled, the Face pale, the extreme Parts cold; a cold Sweat breaks forth, and the Pulſe is very weak, and not ſo hard as in Apoplexies.</p>
                        <p>'Tis diſtinguiſh'd from Hyſteric Fits, by this; that in theſe the Face is always pale, the Pulſe very low and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible, Reſpiration pretty intire, the ſenſe of Feeling oft-times remains; and the Diſorders of the lower Belly have uſher'd 'em in.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>Carus</hi> ſteals on by degrees, and the Reſpiration is eaſy, and oft-times without Snorting. But an Apoplexy purſues a contrary method.</p>
                        <p>If a violent Apoplexy be not follow'd by a Feaver in ſeven days, 'tis mortal. If a difficulty of Breathing be attended with Sweating, 'tis a fatal Omen. If the Fit perſiſt beyond tweuty four hours without remiſſion, there's no hope. In general, all Apoplectic Perſons, tho cur'd, are apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe, and young ſtrong Perſons are more likely to recover than the old and feeble.</p>
                        <p>If it be not mortal, it either determines in a particular Apoplexy, or is diſcuſs'd by Stool and Sweating. <hi>Barbette</hi> relates an inſtance of its being cur'd by voiding Lymph by the
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:207638:257"/>Ear, and upon that account recommends a Salivation for its Cure.</p>
                        <p>In preſcribing the Cure I ſhall firſt take notice of what is fit to be done during the Paroxyſm; and then how we ought to behave after the Paroxyſm is over.</p>
                        <p>As for the time of the Fit; ſharp Clyſters and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitories are approv'd by the general Conſent of all Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. They are proper in all Apoplectic Caſes. They muſt be ſharp to the laſt degree, injected in moderat quantities, in order to be eaſily retain'd; and in caſe of a total Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation of the Sphincter, repeated often; or converted into Cataplaſms by longer boiling, and applied all over the Belly.</p>
                        <p>Vomits and Blood-letting are generally preſcrib'd; but unſeaſonably adminiſtred, murder a great many. In order to avoid miſtakes in this important matter, let us mind the following Cautions.</p>
                        <p>If the Patient be young, luſty, accuſtom'd to a ſedentary Life; if the Face in the Paroxyſm appear red, if there be a ſuppreſſion of any wonted Evacuation of Blood. In a word, if there appear any ſigns of a ſanguin Apoplexy, or a Stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Blood, 'tis highly convenient to bleed. In a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Apoplexy, Bleeding can only act a preſervative part. In a poſitive internal Apoplexy, it can do no manner of good, unleſs by accident, by correcting the Stagnation of the Blood in the Breaſt; upon which account it may be uſeful in the other ſorts.</p>
                        <p>If the Apoplexy be attended with Crudities in the Stomac, occaſion'd by drinking and gluttonizing, as it frequently happens in <hi>Germany;</hi> If the Patient be old or weak; If any narcotic Virulence be ſuſpected, or any Deficiency diſcover'd in the Lymph, and the Blood originally faultleſs; If a Gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs or any ſign of a principal Diſorder in the Head ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; 'tis more adviſable to omit Bleeding, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter a Vomit. To ſum up all, a privative Apoplexy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires Bleeding; or if the Patient be old, Cupping-glaſſes, Scarifications, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A Poſitive demands Vomiting, or in room of that for old Perſons ſharp Clyſters, which turn to the ſame thing; for the Guts are a continuation of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac. Some recommend Bleeding from the jugular Veins. As for Vomits, the Doſe muſt be augmented in the Parox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yſm; and if one do not operat, repeated till they prove ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual. 'Tis moſt convenient to exhibit them in a liquid Form, with ſome ſpirituous cordial Water.</p>
                        <pb n="513" facs="tcp:207638:257"/>
                        <p>The Perſon ought to be ſet upright, whether in Bed or out of Bed; the Room well air'd, and the more ſenſible Parts of the Body frequently twitch'd and pull'd. Then let Blood in the right Arm, if it be convenient; and exhibit a Vomit with all poſſible Expedition, or inject a Clyſter of Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic Herbs with Pulp of Coloquintida, or Infuſion of <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Metallorum,</hi> with Sal Gem or Sal Armoniac, and other volatil Salts. All oily Ingredients muſt be omitted. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Leaves of Tobacco and Sage, Chamomil Flowers, of each a handful; Roots of Pellitory of <hi>Spain</hi> from half an Ounce to ſix Drams; Pulp of Coloquintida ty'd in a Bag a Dram.

                        <p>Take of the Decoction of Chamomil Flowers half a Pound; Infuſion of <hi>Crocus Metallorum</hi> in Wine two or three Ounces; Honey from half an Ounce to an Ounce: mix and make a Clyſter. As for Suppoſitories,</p>

                        <p>In the Interim, ſome Apoplectic mixture may be thrown down the Throat. As,</p>

                        <p>Spirit of Black-cherries is of extraordinary virtue in this caſe. As,</p>

                           <hi>Timaeus</hi>'s <hi>Arcanum</hi> is of excellent uſe in a ſpeechleſs Fit. <hi>viz.</hi>

Doſe as much as will lie upon the point of a Knife, to be exhibited in ſome Apoplectic Vehicle. The Palat and Tongue may be rubb'd with this Electuary, or diſtill'd Oils and Apoplectic Spirits. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of Lilly Convally Water prepar'd with Wine two Ounces; Spirit of Juniper-berries an Ounce; Eſſence of
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:207638:258"/>Caſtor three Drams; volatil Aromatic Salt half a Dram: mix for the above-mentioned uſe.</p>
                        <p>This Method being obſerv'd, if the ſick Perſon do not come to himſelf in a quarter of an hour, blow the following Pouder into the Noſtrils, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Take of the Roots of white Hellebor, and Pellitory of <hi>Spain,</hi> Marjoram Leaves, Flowers of Lilly of the Valley, Caſtor, of each a Scruple: make a Pouder, and uſe as above. Or,</p>

                        <p>Spirit of Urine, Spirit of Sal Armoniac, and Spirit of Hartſhorn ſuccinated, are fit for the ſame uſe; or the Fumes of Caſtor and Amber may be receiv'd at the Noſtrils; and the Temples and Noſe anointed with Apoplectic Balſams, or bath'd with the following Mixture.</p>
                        <p>Take of Baum Water, Lilly Convally Water prepar'd with Wine, of each two Ounces; Apoplectic Water, an Ounce; Vinegar of Rue, two Drams. Mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The rectify'd Oil and volatil Salt of Amber, mix'd with Apoplectic Waters, are given inwardly with wonderful ſucceſs; or with Camphyr, or Oil of Camphyr drop'd into the Ear. The Back, Neck, Temples and Stomac, may alſo be fomented with it, or the following Mixture.</p>
                        <p>Take of expreſs'd Oil of Mace, a Dram and a half; diſtill'd Oil of Rue, a Scruple; Oil of Spike, Oil of Amber, of each half a Scruple. Or,</p>

                        <p>If the Paroxyſm do not yield to theſe Medicines; the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits and Clyſters muſt be repeated, bliſtering Plaiſters ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Neck, Arms, Thighs, Wriſts, behind the Ears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Feet rub'd and chaf'd with Pickle, or Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and Salt, and the external Parts of the Body prick'd and twitch'd.</p>
                        <p>Having thus diſcuſs'd the Fit, it remains now to corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat Nature, and prevent future Paroxyſms by a preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Cure. For which purpoſe, after Purgation, Sudorifics and Stomachics are moſt proper. Sage is much applauded;
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:207638:259"/>as alſo Cubebs, Cardamom, Rocket-ſeeds, and Muſtard-ſeeds. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of Cardamoms, half a Dram; Coriander-ſeed, two drams; Rocket-ſeeds, half an Ounce: make a Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for ſeveral Doſes to be taken when going to Bed. 'Tis a very good Preſervative. If an Electuary be more acceptable,</p>
                        <p>Take three large Figs, and a ſpoonful of Rocket or Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard-ſeed; mix them in a Mortar, adding a ſpoonful of ſtrong Lavender Water, and half an Ounce of the Juice of Violets. Doſe, the Bigneſs of a Walnut to be taken every Morning, and after Dinner. Let the Perſon take ſome drops of Spirit of Sal Armoniac aniſated, or the Carminative Spirit <hi>de tribus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Some diſtil a urinous Spirit from Rocket-ſeeds and Quick lime, which is of admirable uſe. Spirit of Black Cherries is receiv'd by all as a great Specific; And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Spirit of Vitriol, thus prepar'd.</p>
                        <p>Take of Hungarian Vitriol calcined in the Sun, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient quantity; with Spirit of Wine drawn off from Aromatic Plants, reduce it to the conſiſtence of a Pultiſe. Let it ſtand and digeſt ſome weeks, and then diſtill with an open fire. Take the Spirit thus drawn off and diſtil it thro an Alembic; 'twill come off chafer'd; when it appears Cloudy, change the Receptacle, and receive a volatil Spirit of Vitriol. Mix all the Spirits, and after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion cohobat 'em.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Maebius</hi> his Apoplectic Spirit is very uſeful, <hi>viz.</hi> Take of the Flowers of Lilly Convally ſix pound; Cinamom one pound; Zedoary half a pound; Saffron an Ounce; Mace and Cloves, of each half an Ounce. Let 'em digeſt in Spaniſh Wine for a Month, and then diſtil the Spirit, in which ſteep the following Ingredients.</p>
                        <p>Take Roots of Valerian, Swallowwort and Piony, of each two Ounces; the Leaves of Baum, Oak of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and Roſemary, of each three handfuls; Lime-tree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers ſix handfuls; Flowers of Lavender, Spike, Sage and Thyme, of each a handful. Macerat them in the Spirit for a month in a cloſe Veſſel; then add a ſufficient quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Spaniſh Wine, and diſtil the Spirit, which may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be rectify'd upon-Amber, Moſch and Camphyr. 'Tis a noble Apoplectic Medicine; but is not fit to be given in the Paroxyſm: For ſuch inflammable oily Spirits have a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifying quality, and are very offenſive to ſome People. In
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:207638:259"/>a ſanguin Apoplexy, the volatil urinous Spirits, and lean volatil Salts are preferable to theſe ſulphurous Medicines.</p>
                        <p>Eſſence of Caſtor mix'd with vegetable Spirits, Spirit of Sal Armoniac camphoris'd, the volatil Salts of human Blood, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Scull, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are all much approv'd. In fine, from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit variety of Apoplectic Medicines, I ſhall ſingle out the following Recipe's.</p>
                        <p>Take of Quinteſſence of Roſemary, two Drams and a half; Quinteſſence of Lavender, a Dram and a half; mix, and give twenty drops every Morning; and in the Evening thirty drops of Spirit of Sal Armoniac. Or,</p>

                        <p>Take of the Waters of the Flowers of the Lime-tree, Lavender and Primroſes, of each an Ounce; Apoplectic Water, Spirit of Black Cherries, of each a Dram and a half; Eſſence of Primroſes, three Drams; volatil Salt of Amber, half a Dram; Syrup of Clove Gilly-flowers, an Ounce and a half.

                           <hi>Poterius</hi>'s Diaphoretic Gold, given with Conſerve of Clove Gilly-flowers, is a famous Specific: Likewiſe the following Pouder.</p>

With Syrup of Clove Gilly-flowers make an Electuary.</p>
                        <p>Take of Conſerve of Roſemary-flowers, Conſerve of Sage-flowers, of each half an Ounce; Confection Alker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes two Drams; Pouder of Caſtor, the Pouder <hi>Diambra</hi> and <hi>Diamoſchus dulcis,</hi> of each a Scruple; Cinnabar of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, diſtill'd Oil of Amber, of each half a Dram.

Mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This was <hi>Kolbius</hi>'s Mixture, ſo much celebrated for its Vertue againſt Apoplexies: But it may be rendred more effectual by adding Rocket-ſeeds, and Muſtards-ſeeds.</p>
                        <pb n="519" facs="tcp:207638:260"/>
                        <p>All theſe Preſcriptions are proper to be us'd both in and after the Paroxyſm. Now in purſuance of the preſerving Cure, let us view the evacuating Medicines fit to be given after or before the Paroxyſm. Among which, Vomits ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Precedency, as <hi>Mercurius Vitae.</hi> Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Mynſichtius</hi> his Emetic Tartar two Grains; Sal Armoniac nine Grains. Make a Pouder. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of Tartar vitriolated ſix Grains; <hi>Mynſichtius</hi>'s Emetic Tartar two Grains; Scammony ſulphurated one Grain.</p>
                        <p>Purgative Medicines are next in order. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Crato</hi>'s Pills of Amber, Extract of Wormwood, of each half a Scruple; Extract of Troches Alhandal, one Grain; diſtill'd Oil of Amber two Drops. With Eſſence of Primroſes make Pills.</p>
                        <p>Take of ſweet Mercury a Scruple; Scammony ſulphurat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed five Grains. With Conſerve of Clove Gilly-flowers make a Bolus.</p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Ruffus</hi> his Pills <hi>de tribus,</hi> half a Scruple; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of black Hellebor five Grains; Tartar vitriolated, three Grains. With diſtill'd Oil of Caraways make Pills.</p>
                        <p>Take of Gum Ammoniac diſſolv'd in Vinegar, Bdellium diſſolv'd in Vinegar, of each half a Dram; Vitriol of Steel calcinated till it become white, a Scruple; Magiſtery of the Gum of Peru fifteen Grains; Scammony prepar'd according to <hi>Brendelius</hi>'s Method, a Scruple; Extract of Troches Alhandal ſix Grains: make a Maſs for Pills, fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen of which are one Doſe.</p>
                        <p>The Decoction of ſudorific Woods are very proper in the declination of the Paroxyſm, and ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for ſome time.</p>
                        <p>If theſe and ſuch like Remedies do not accompliſh the Cure, we muſt have recourſe to Setums, Cuppingglaſſes, Iſſues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If the Perſon be of a Catarrhous Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, an Iſſue in the pit of the Neck is very proper. But theſe external Helps are of no uſe in poſitive Apoplexies; in the privative indeed, where the Blood or Lymph is faulty, they frequently afford relief.</p>
                        <p>The Plaiſter <hi>de Ranis,</hi> with Mercury, mix'd with Balſam of Peru diſſolv'd with the Yelk of an Egg, may be applied to the Head with good ſucceſs. When the Diſeaſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines, a Salivation perhaps may not be improper.</p>

                        <head>ART. II. <hi>Of particular Apoplexies.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>WHEN an Apoplexy ſeizes a particular part, 'tis call'd Paraplegia, and by moſt of Writers is referr'd to Palſies; but the frequent reciprocal Permutation of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Apoplexies and Paraplegia's vouch for their near alliance. Sometimes it is only a retainer to a univerſal Apoplexy, at other times it comes of it ſelf in the form of a principal Diſeaſe. It admits of three degrees; 1. When the Senſe of the Part remains, and only its motion is loſt. 2. When 'tis depriv'd both of Senſe and Motion; but retains its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat. 3. When 'tis deſtitute of Senſe, Motion and Heat, and becomes flaccid and ſoft.</p>
                        <p>Some aſſign the Obſtruction of the Nerves for its Cauſe, but Experience teaches us that it may proceed by conſent from other parts; from Hyſteric Fits, Worms in the Guts, and the Paſtions of the Mind. The true cauſe ſeems to be the contraction of the nervous Parts about the root of the Spinal Marrow, which interrupts the intercourſe of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to the part affected, perhaps by the conſent of the Nerves; as the Stone in the Kidneys is wont to ſtupify the Leg of the reſpective ſide.</p>
                        <p>It undergoes a frequent Permutation into Convulſions and Palſies. The manner of its ſucceſſion to privative Apoplexies is accounted for above. It ſucceeds likewiſe to poſitive Apoplexies, and in that caſe ſeems to be tinctur'd with a convulſive Quality.</p>
                        <p>The Method of cure is the ſame, as that of an univerſal Apoplexy. Vomits are always proper, eſpecially if it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low an univerſal Apoplexy. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Mercurius Vitae</hi> two Grains; Scammony ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurated three Grains: with Conſerve of Bugloſs-flowers make a Bolus.</p>
                        <p>If Vomiting be very uneaſy to the Patient, give a ſtrong Purge. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of Reſin of Jalap half a Scruple; diſſolve it with the yelk of an Egg in Fumitory Water ſix drams, Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namom Water a Dram. Mix.</p>
                        <p>When it follows privative Apoplexies, Bloodletting is proper; otherwiſe it ought to be avoided, except in the caſe of a Plaethora. Iſſues, Bliſtering Plaiſters laid on the Pit of the Neck, and ſcarify'd Cupping-glaſſes applied
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:207638:261"/>between the Shoulders are likewiſe uſeful againſt this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative ſort.</p>
                        <p>Theſe general Remedies being premis'd, Sudorifics come next, as the volatil Salts and Spirits of human Scull, or human Blood, and all Apoplectic or Epileptic Specifics. The Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Woods, with Juniper and Laurel-berries, and Roots of Elecampane, is very much us'd for this purpoſe. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of Saſſafras Wood two Ounces; Roſemary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves, a handful or two; freſh juicy Juniper-berries, or Laurel-berries, an Ounce and a half, or two Ounces; boil 'em in a <hi>Balneum Mariae</hi> in Wine and Water, of each a pound and a half, with an Alembic. Mix the ſtrain'd Decoction and the diſtill'd Liquor, and add of Spirit of Juniper-berries four Ounces; Spirit of Sal Armoniac three or four Drams; Syrup of Clove Gilly-flowers three Ounces. Mix, and give a large draught thrice a day.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Poterius</hi>'s Diaphoretic Gold is admirably fitted for this Caſe. He either prepar'd it of Gold calcined by Amalga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; or, mix'd <hi>Aurum fulminans</hi> with a double quantity of flowers of Sulphur, and reduc'd it to a Pouder of a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Colour, by putting red hot Coals into the Crucible; then digeſted it for fifteen days in rectify'd Spirit of Wine impregnated with Aniſeeds; and afterwards ſeparat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Spirit either by diſtillation or deflagration, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd the Pouder for uſe. 'Tis not fit to be given in a liquid form, for that it ſinks to the bottom: but thus,</p>
                        <p>Take of Conſerve of Clove Gilly-flowers a Dram; Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoretic Gold, from fifteen Grains to a Scruple. Make a Bolus for two Doſes. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of prepar'd human Scull, prepar'd Unicorn's Horn, of each fifteen Grains; Diaphoretic Gold half a Scruple. Mix. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of human Scull prepar'd without fire, prepar'd red Coral, of each fifteen Grains; fulminatory Gold three Grains. Mix. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of human Scull prepar'd without fire, prepar'd Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn's Horn, of each twelve Grains; fulminatory Gold four Grains; volatil Salt of Vipers ſix Grains. Mix.</p>
                        <p>After the firſt Doſe of theſe Pouders, the Perſon may take a ſpoonful or two of Spirit of Triacle, and then make account to ſweat. Cinnabar of Antimony is likewiſe a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sudorific. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of Cinnabar of Antimony fifteen Grains; Amber half a Scruple; volatil Salt of Amber five Grains: make a Pouder. Or,</p>
                        <pb n="522" facs="tcp:207638:262"/>
                        <p>Take of prepar'd human Scull, prepar'd red Coral, Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabar of Antimony, of each half a Scruple; diſtill'd Oils of Cinnamom and of Cloves, of each a Drop. Make a Pouder to be taken in a convenient Vehicle. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of Black Cherry Water, Lilly Convally Water, Mint Water, of each an Ounce; Spirit of Black Cherries ſix Drams; Cinnabar of Antimony half a Dram; volatil Salt of Hartſhorn fifteen Grains; Syrup of Clove Gilly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers an Ounce. Mix.</p>
                        <p>For an Apoplexy of the Hands, foment the Pit of the Neck with diſtill'd Oils and ſpirituous Waters. If the Feet be affected, apply them to the Loins and neighbouring Parts. But fat expreſs'd Oils muſt be avoided.</p>
                        <p>Take of Muſtardſeeds one part; Juniper-berries two parts; bruiſe and infuſe them in Spirit of Wine, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve for Fomentation.</p>
                        <p>Take of Spirit of Wine camphoris'd, or Spirit of Ants, three Ounces; Spirit of Earthworms an Ounce and a half; Eſſence of Caſtor ſix Drams; Spirit of Sal Armoniac with Quicklime three Drams: mix and bathe the Back-bone im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after ſweating, applying afterwards a warm Cloth fumigated with Gum Ammoniac, or rubbing it with diſtill'd Oils mix'd with Oil of Tartar, or ſome of the Oils of the fat and hard parts of Animals, ſtrip'd of their nauſeous ſtink by frequent Cohobation upon their <hi>Caput Mortuum.</hi> If they are of themſelves too ſharp, or apt to draw Bliſters, qualify 'em with the Oil of Earthworms by decoction.</p>
                        <p>If the part affected be apt to wither and conſume; tho the root of the Evil be not ſeated in it, 'tis not improper to anoint it with the following Mixture, in order to provoke and waken the Spirits.</p>
                        <p>Take of Spirit of Earth-worms three Ounces; diſtill'd Oils of Spike, and of Juniper, of each a Dram and a half; diſtill'd Oils of Lavender and Marjoram, of each half a Dram; diſtill'd Oil of Amber two Scruples; plumous Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum (which ought always to be added in this caſe) a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                        <p>If this prove too ſharp, as it frequently do's to ſcorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Conſtitutions, take of human or Gooſe fat three or four Ounces; diſtill'd Oil of Turpentin three Drams; Oil of Juniper-berries two Drams; Oil of Spike half a Dram. Mix, and uſe as above.</p>
                        <p>Let the following Plaiſter be likewiſe applied to the Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="523" facs="tcp:207638:262"/>
                        <p>Take of Gum Galbanum two parts; Gum Caran one part; ſoften 'em with ſtone Oil into the Conſiſtence of a Plaiſter.</p>
                        <p>Bathing in a Decoction of Ants is of ſingular Virtue both in this and many other caſes; of which more elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>

                        <head>ART. III. <hi>Of a Palſy.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>A Palſy ought to be carefully diſtinguiſh'd from a ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of any part, and particular Apoplexies, tho it be near ally'd to both. The former retains the power of mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, tho depriv'd of the Senſe of Feeling; the latter relates to the Diſorders of the Nerves: whereas a Palſy is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally a relaxation of the Tendons, Fibres and Ligaments by which the part is moved, the Nerves being only ſecondarily affected. So a true formal Palſy affects chiefly the moving Faculty, and if the Nerves are not much touch'd, the ſenſe of Feeling remains. Now by this it appears that in many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes a Palſy is accus'd, where particular Apoplexies are the true Criminals. Their difference is thus made out, 1. The particular Apoplexies are retainers to the Diſorders of the Brain and ſpinal Marrow; whereas Palſies follow another ſet of Diſeaſes, as the Scurvy, Hypochondriac and Colic Fits, and exceſſive Drinking. 2. In the former the original and uppermoſt part of the Nerves is chiefly affected, and upon that account external Remedies are applied to the Neck and Back-bone, without regard to the Apoplectic Part. But in the latter, that part of the Nerve which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the Muſcles of the place, is principally injur'd, and accordingly external Applications are confin'd to that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. 3. The former deprives both of ſenſe and motion; the latter oftimes retains the ſenſe, and is moleſted with pains. 4. The former are conſtant and obſtinat; the latter relents now and then, and 'tis not quite ſo hard a matter to compaſs its Cure.</p>
                        <p>Some Palſies are call'd Privative, when the Paſſages for the Spirits are ſtraiten'd and embaraſs'd, by Obſtructions or Compreſſions of the Nerves, the ſudden retreat of the ſmall Pox, Wounds, Falls, and ſuch like external Cauſes. But theſe are more properly particular Apoplexies. A true poſitive Palſy may be occaſion'd by a cold moiſt Air, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:207638:263"/>in cold Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus old Men and Children are as it were half paralytic; the former by reaſon of a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Serum that ſucceeds in the room of their exhauſted nutritious Juice, and unbends the Fibres; the latter by virtue of overflowing Moiſture.</p>
                        <p>The uſual internal Cauſe of a Palſy is an acid Humour convey'd along with the Lymph or Serum to the affected part, where it vitiats the Fibres, and renders 'em unfit for their wonted Motions. Palſies of this kind are frequently occaſion'd by immoderat drinking of ſome Wines that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of a notable volatil Acid, which not being concocted in the Stomac, is thrown upon the external parts, and creates in them ſometimes a tickling ſort of Pain, reſembling the motion of Piſmires; ſometimes a ſtupid, and ſometimes a tearing Pain: Thus the Fibres are corrupted, but the Nerves are at firſt ſecure; and accordingly the moving Faculty is extinguiſh'd, while that of Feeling remains intire, tho in progreſs of time it may dwindle away.</p>
                        <p>A ſcorbutic Acid join'd to a ſerous Vehicle, frequently cauſes Palſies. It proceeds inſenſibly; at firſt cauſes a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Stupidity and Titillation of the Fingers or Toes. One day they are quite well, another day mightily ſwell'd, and retain the Senſe of Feeling, tho render'd in ſome meaſure ſtupid; and the Perſon when lying can move 'em; but if he attempt to ſtand, can perform no progreſſive Motion without a great deal of pain. 'Tis a volatil auſtere Acid that gives riſe to theſe Symptoms; and if Auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity prevail, Convulſions and Contractions invade the part.</p>
                        <p>The French Pox, Worms in the Guts, and Suffocations of the Matrix may procure Palſies: But the Bilious Colic, that proceeds from thin ſharp Humours, more frequently introduces 'em. If theſe Colic Pains be exaſperated by violent Purgation, or otherwiſe, as it frequently happens, the Navel being drawn inwards, and the Belly very much bound and grip'd, there follows a Stupidity, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Paralytic Diſpoſition of ſome Members of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. In this caſe the Cauſe ſeems to be a Scorbutic Acid lodg'd in the nervous Knot of the Meſentery, which contracts the Nerves, and ſo prevents the regular diſtribution of the Spirits to theſe Parts: So that partly by the mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Membrans, and partly by the Tranſlation of the morbific Matter to the external Parts, ſuch Palſies take their riſe. The ſuppreſſion of wonted Evacuations of Blood, and
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:207638:263"/>the Paſſions of the Mind, eſpecially Grief and Want are likewiſe apt to cauſe 'em.</p>
                        <p>Beſides theſe internal Cauſes, there are ſeveral external Occaſions of Palſies; as touching the Cramp-fiſh, or ſome Indian Shell-fiſhes, reported to be indow'd with a numming Virtue; approaching to mercurial and mineral Fumes, and an indiſcreet tampering with Narcotics.</p>
                        <p>If the Nerves be chiefly affected, as in a total Privation of feeling, or when the Diſeaſe proceeds from a Wound, Fall, or other external Accidents, or ſucceeds an Apoplexy, the Original of the Nerves muſt be chiefly regarded, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Method propos'd for particular Apoplexies. If the Senſe of Feeling be intire, or not much impair'd, the Ligaments and Tendons of the part affected ought to be moſt taken care of. If a Palſy invade the Face, 'tis diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd from a Dog-Cramp by this, that in the former the paralytic part is ſoft and flaccid, and eaſily reduc'd to its natural poſture; but in the latter, the contracted Part is hard, and cannot be brought to join the others without pain. As for the privative Palſies that approach to the nature of Apoplexies, or in which the Senſe of Feeling is quite loſt, or the Evil inveterat and fix'd to a Part, their Cure will be very difficult: but if once cur'd, they are not ſo apt to relapſe, as the proper poſitive Palſies proceeding from internal Cauſes. If the heat of the part be quite extinguiſh'd, and Contractions ſeize it: If the Eye of the paralytic Side be leſſen'd: If the Perſon be old and of a Cacochymical or Cachectic Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: they are all croſs Circumſtances. If a Trembling invade the Part: If a Looſeneſs ſucceed to a light Palſy, or an acute Feaver to the Apoplectic Sort: they are eſteem'd Signs of Recovery.</p>
                        <p>In regulating the method of Cure, we muſt heedfully diſtinguiſh the privative apoplectic Palſies from the poſitive ſort: If the former ariſe from external Cauſes, the Cure turns upon their removal, and inunctions of the part with the Queen of <hi>Hungary</hi>'s Water, Rock Oil, Oil of Juniper, Oil of Lavender, and above all Balſam of Peru. Internal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nothing equals Oil of Lavender taken to the quantity of four or ſix drops in bed, in order to ſweat; for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe diſtill'd Oil of Amber is likewiſe proper. If they proceed from internal Cauſes, Sudorific and Cephalic Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines are us'd in the ſame manner as for particular Apoplexies; and in an inveterat Caſe a Salivation is the laſt Refuge.</p>
                        <pb n="526" facs="tcp:207638:264"/>
                        <p>As for poſitive Palſies, the peccant matter muſt be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and diſcharg'd by aromatic and volatil Sudorifics, and the nervous Parts corroborated and reſtor'd to life by the external application of penetrating meagre Oils. In order to compaſs theſe ends, 'twill be needful to obſerve the following Rules.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Since the peccant matter is an Acid that owes its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal to the firſt Paſſages, Saline Digeſtives, Vomits and ſharp Clyſters ought to be premis'd; and whatever purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Medicines are us'd, they muſt be very gentle, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the beginning. 2. A temperat milk Diet ought to be cloſely purſu'd; for that it vanquiſhes any Acid, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the Nerves with a Chyl-like Juice, capable to repair their loſs of moiſture, occcaſion'd by copious Sweats. 3. When a Palſy is caus'd by a Colic or Scurvy, by all means avoid ſtrong Purges, leſt Convulſions inſue. Soft Laxatives, in which black Hellebor is the chief Ingredient, may be ventur'd upon. Or Clyſters impregnated with Carminative Oils may be frequently injected; but at firſt they muſt be gentle and ſoft, as thoſe of Milk and Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in the progreſs of the Diſeaſe if the Patient reap no benefit by 'em, you may add a ſmall Whet, 4. Fat viſcous Oils are improper for external Uſe. Penetrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſpirituous Liniments are only convenient, and ought always to be us'd immediately after Sweating, while the Pores are yet open. Indeed if the Perſon be ſcorbutic, temperat things are beſt to begin with. And when the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected part begins to wither, and the Perſon withal is of a choleric Conſtitution, 'tis adviſable to abſtain from apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe ſubtil volatil Remedies. But where a Palſy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a Corruption of the Lymph, and the part is ſwell'd up, they are very needful. 5. If the ſtopping of any wonted Evacuation of Blood give riſe to a Palſy, repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Blood-letting is wont to finiſh the Cure.</p>
                        <p>I am now advanc'd to the Preſcriptions of proper Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. For Vomiting, the Flowers of Antimony, with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of Scammony are recommended by <hi>Hartman.</hi> For Purging, Sweet Mercury is much applauded by <hi>Sylvius,</hi> and Turpentin by <hi>Platerus:</hi> Hellebor and Turbith are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally approv'd; but Coloquintida ought always to be added for a Whet.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Arthritic Pills a Scruple; Scammony ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated four Grains; Extract of Troches Alhandal a Grain: With Eſſence of Sage make Pills. Or,</p>
                        <pb n="527" facs="tcp:207638:264"/>
                        <p>Take of the Herbs Germander and Groundpine, of each a handful; Flowers of Roſemary, of Primroſes, and of Sage, of each two little handfuls; Roots of Angelica, Maſterwort, and Florentin Orris, of each three Drams; Roots of black Hellebor a Dram; pick'd Senna, ſix Drams; Roots of common Spurge half a Dram; Cardamoms and Cubebs, of each three Drams; Salt of Tartar a Dram and a half. Mix for a Bag to be infus'd in Wine.</p>
                        <p>Sudorific Decoctions of Guajacum, Burdoc, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are much in uſe: But <hi>Willis</hi> has remark'd that thoſe whoſe Blood is ſtuff'd with a fix'd Salt, and not much diluted with inſpid Serum, are apt to be offended by Sweating.</p>
                        <p>The internal Specifics for this Diſeaſe are much the ſame as thoſe for Apoplexies and Epilepſies. The Decoction of Roſemary over a gentle Fire in <hi>Balneum Mariae,</hi> mix'd with a little Eſſence of Caſtor, is a noble Medicine. A large draught of it ought to be taken in the Morning with a faſting Stomac. Primroſes, French Lavender, diſtill'd Oils of Lavender and Amber are much approv'd. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Elecampane is a ſovereign Remedy for Palſies ariſing from a Colic. Saſſafras and Guajacum are of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent uſe, eſpecially the former; Roſemary and Juniper or Bay-berries ought always to be boil'd with em. <hi>Poterius</hi> found great benefit by the following Preſcription.</p>
                        <p>Take of the ſhavings of Saſſafras Wood one Ounce; Bay-berries an Ounce and a half; boil them in ſix pound of Wine to three pound, and reſerve it for uſe.</p>
                        <p>Inſtead of the Decoctions of theſe Woods, Eſſences and Spirits may be prepar'd from 'em, that are of ſingular uſe. <hi>Lindanus</hi> recommends a Wood call'd <hi>Pavana,</hi> given to the quantiry of two Scruples in a ſpoonful of Spirit of Wine: It procures Vomiting, Purging and Sweating, without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the ſtrength of the Perſon. Millet-ſeeds are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe very proper for procuring Sweat. The volatil Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Tartar, are wonderfully extoll'd. Its volatil Salt or Spirit, drawn from the dregs of Wine or ſtinking Oil of Tartar, or the Spirit of Tartar cohobated with tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris'd Spirit of Urine, are very uſeful in Cholic, Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driac, and Scorbutic Palſies. <hi>Sylvius</hi> was wont to cure Cholic Palſies with his <hi>Sal volatile Oleoſum.</hi> Next are the Spirit and volatil Salt of Urine prepar'd by putrefaction, Spirit of Sal Armoniac, Spirit of Lavender, the Spirit and volatil Salt of Vipers, Spirit of Hartſhorn ſuccinated,
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:207638:265"/>volatil Salt of Amber, given along with Cinnabar of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, and Magiſtery of Pearls: But above all, the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil Preparations from Worms and Ants, have merited the greateſt approbation. If you digeſt a vegetable Spirit with Ants for ſome time, you'll have an incomparable Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine that may be us'd both internally and externally.</p>
                        <p>But withal we are to remember that theſe volatil Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are not fit to be given upon the firſt invaſion of the Diſeaſe, till the Acid in the firſt Paſſages be in a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure vanquiſh'd. Upon which account the fix'd Abſorbents ought to lead the Van. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of prepar'd human Bones, from a Scruple to half a Dram; Cinnabar of Antimony, from twelve to twenty Grains; volatil Salt of Amber, from ten to twelve Grains. Make a Pouder for two Doſes. Now after a diſcreet uſe of ſuch like fix'd Medicines, is the time to exhibit the volatil Sudorifics.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Poterius</hi>'s Diaphoretic Gold is a noted Specific. Six Grains may be given for a Doſe. <hi>Helmont</hi> commends the volatil Tincture of Coral. I have ſeen an admirable Tincturemade with volatil Spirit of Tartar in his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain</hi>'s Laboratory; but Mr. <hi>Febure</hi> conceal'd the way of Preparation.</p>
                        <p>If a poſitive Palſy proceed from the Relaxation, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Moiſture of any Part, 'tis convenient to anoint both the Part it ſelf, and the Back-bone, with the following Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niment.</p>
                        <p>Take of human and Gooſe Fat, of each an Ounce; Oil of Earth three Drams. Mix. Tacamahac and Balſam of Peru are fit for the ſame uſe. The Plaiſter for the Nerves of Tacamahac and Galbanum ſoftn'd in diſtill'd Oil of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Oil of Bricks may be applied to the Joints. If the Ligaments are much unbended and flat, apply <hi>Crollius</hi>'s ſtyptic Plaiſter ſoften'd with Oil of Bricks and Oil of Earth, and in the mean while endeavour to procure Sweat, by giving <hi>Venice</hi> Triacle inwardly. <hi>Barbette</hi> recommends the following Plaiſter,</p>
                        <p>Take of Gum Caran half an Ounce; Galbanum an Ounce; Oil of Euphorbium a Dram and a half. Make a Plaiſter.</p>
                        <p>If the Diſeaſe proceed from mercurial Fumes, exhibit the Decoction of Elecampane and Fennel; and after the Mercury is thrown out by ſweating, let the Patient drink Whey or Milk.</p>
                        <p>In a ſcorbutic light Palſy, the urinous volatil Medicines, and Milk are proper. The Decoction of Pine-Apple is likewiſe much commended. Or,</p>
                        <pb n="529" facs="tcp:207638:265"/>
                        <p>Take of the Tendrels of Fir an Ounce and a half; China Roots an Ounce; cut them ſmall, and boil them in Ale and Water till the half be conſum'd. Give a draught of the ſtrain'd liquor twice a day. Theſe Ingredients may be alſo boil'd in Milk.</p>
                        <p>The Decoction of Betony with Juniper berries; or an Eſſence prepar'd from the Rob of Pine-apples with ſome Antiſcorbutic Spirit, and mix'd with Caſtor, are very proper. After a regular uſe of fix'd Abſorbents and volatil Medicines, Milk or Whey mix'd with Antiſcorbutics is a ſovereign Remedy; but it ought always to follow theſe Premiſes. Iſſues and Setums are not improper in this Caſe.</p>
                        <p>If a Palſy proceed from the Colic; the Belly muſt be chiefly taken care of; Lenitive Clyſters of Turpentin and Milk frequently injected: and ſtrong Purgatives carefully avoided. The Decoction of Elecampane, of Millet-ſeeds and the four hot Seeds, and Saſſafras, are proper Sudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifics. Whey mix'd with Antiſcorbutics is much eſteem'd. Let the Navel and part affected be fomented with Spirit of Tartar or of Sal Armoniac, and anointed thrice a day with <hi>Paracelſus</hi> his <hi>Galbanetum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So much for the internal Cure of Palſies, It remains now to conſider the external Forms. If the Diſeaſe be inveterat, and the Part begin to wither, temperat fat Oils are proper. If the ſenſe of Feeling be not much impair'd, and the power of Moving only loſt, the ſtrong Apoplectic Waters, or rectify'd Spirit of Wine, in which the Pouders of Muſtard-ſeeds, Pepper, Rue-ſeeds, Nettle-ſeeds, Aron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roots, and Pellitory of <hi>Spain,</hi> have been infus'd and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, are fit for external Fomentation. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of freſh Tobacco-leaves a handful or two; Leaves of Origanum, Flowers of Elder, of each a handful; Roots of Angelica, from an Ounce to two Ounces; Roots of Pellitory of <hi>Spain,</hi> Aron-roots, of each an Ounce; Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorbium, Caſtor and Myrrh, of each from half an Ounce: to ſix Drams; white and black Pepper, of each three Drams; Flowers of Arabian Stechas, of Lavender, and Lilly Convally, of each half an Ounce; Rocket-ſeeds or Muſtard-ſeeds, Seeds of Mountain-Siler, from ſix Drams to an Ounce and a half: cut and beat them ſmall; and pour upon 'em of rectify'd Spirit of Wine two parts, of Spirit of Earth-worms one part: digeſt 'em in a <hi>Balneum Mariae;</hi> and draw off the Spirit by diſtillation. With which foment the parts immediatly after ſweating. Or,</p>
                        <pb n="530" facs="tcp:207638:266" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <p>Take of the Herbs Roſemary, Sage, Marjoram or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender, of each a handful; Lavender-flowers, Lilly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vally-flowers, and Roſemary-flowers, of each two little handfuls; Juniper-berries an Ounce; Muſtard-ſeeds, from half an Ounce to an Ounce; Caſtor three Drams; black Pepper a Dram and a half. Infuſe them in Spirit of Wine, and after digeſtion reſerve the ſtrain'd Liquor for uſe as above. And if the Diſeaſe be accompany'd by ſcorbutic Pains, add to it ſome Spirit of Sal Armoniac prepar'd with Quick-lime. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Aqua Articularis</hi> for external uſe, two, three or four Ounces; Spirit of Sal Armoniac with Quick-lime, from an Ounce to two Ounces; Spirit of Earth-worms pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd by putrefaction half an Ounce. Mix, and bathe the part thrice a day. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of Spirit of Wine camphoris'd three Ounces; Spirit of putrify'd Earth-worms an Ounce; Eſſence of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor ſix Drams. Mix, and uſe as above. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of Apoplectic Water three Ounces; Spirit of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trify'd Earth-worms, and Spirit of Sal Armoniac ſuccinat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of each half an Ounce. Mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In a Colic Palſy, rectify'd Spirit of Tartar mix'd or cohobated with Spirit of Wine tartaris'd, are externally us'd with great ſucceſs. Balſam of Peru diſſolv'd with the Yelk of an Egg, and mix'd with Eſſence of Amber ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by rectify'd Spirit of Wine, is much approv'd for external uſe in all ſorts of Palſies.</p>
                        <p>Take of common ſtinging Nettles three handfuls; Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momil one handful; Cumin-ſeeds a Dram; Salt three Ounces: beat 'em well in a Mortar, and boil them in a ſufficient quantity of human Urine, till the fourth part be conſum'd. Bathe the part Morning and Evening with this Decoction, and wrap it up in a Cloth dip'd in the Liquor, and after three or four days anoint it with Oil of Foxes. In Apoplectic Palſies pricking with Nettles is a very ſucceſsful Remedy. Bathing in fermenting Wine, or ſuch as is reduc'd to a Fermentation by throwing Quick-lime in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, is of extraordinary uſe both againſt Palſies and Scia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica's; for by this means the volatil Tartar of the Wine inſinuats it ſelf into the Part. A bag full of Ants thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to boiling Water yields a Vapor, which is conveniently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd upon the part, is very ſerviceable; after the Bag has loſt its ſmell, it may be boil'd in Water for the Patient to bathe in.</p>
                        <pb n="531" facs="tcp:207638:266"/>
                        <p>Take of Brimſtone, and Bay-berries, of each half a pound; Roots of Gentian three handfuls; Roots of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campane, and long Birth-wort, of each two handfuls: boil them in Quick-lime Water for an artificial Bath.</p>
                        <p>The laſt Refuge is the Hot-baths: But if a Colic, or uſe of Wine gave riſe to the Diſeaſe, or arthritic and gouty Pains accompany it, they are not proper. In a word, they are more convenient for a Sanguin or Phlegmatic, than a Choleric Conſtitution.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Herbs Marjoram and Sage, of each a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; Roſemary two handfuls; Juniper-berries four Ounces; Bay-berries two Ounces; Roots of Pellitory of <hi>Spain</hi> an Ounce. Boil them in Water, and place the hot Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on under the Perſon's Feet, that the Fumes may aſcend.</p>
                        <p>Take of Galbanum half a pound; Oil of Turpentin a pound and a half: diſtil the Oil from them, to which add an Ounce of Oil of Lavender; and then repeat the diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which produces an excellent Balſam to be digeſted and circulated with rectify'd or tartaris'd Spirit of Wine. This may be applied to the Navel, Back, or Part affected, as occaſion requires.</p>
                        <p>Take of white Rock Oil two Drams; diſtill'd Oil of Amber half a Dram; diſtill'd Oils of Lavender, Marjoram and Spike, of each a Scruple: mix, and anoint the affected parts.</p>
                        <p>As for Plaiſters, thoſe of Tacamahac are moſt approv'd, eſpecially when the Nerves are overcharg'd with Moiſture. But if the Perſon be ſcorbutic, or the Part depriv'd of all manner of Senſe, temperat oily things are beſt: As,</p>
                        <p>Take of human or Gooſe fat, of each three, four, or ſix Ounces; diſtill'd Oil of Turpentin three Drams; Oil of Juniper-berries a Dram; Oil of Spike half a Dram. Mix, and anoint the Part. Or,</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THE Intellect or Rational Faculty being immaterial, cannot be vitiated of it ſelf by any morbific Cauſe; but for ſo much as 'tis converſant about the Objects of our internal Senſes, it makes uſe of their Miniſtry; and if they are out of order, ſhares of the common Calamity. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Senſes are the Imagination and Memory, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the regular Motion of the Animal Spirits in the Brain, and run into diſorder upon their Enormities, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears <hi>a poſteriori</hi> by ridiculous Geſtures, Words and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Thus whatever impairs the right uſe of Reaſon, muſt immediatly affect the Imagination and Memory.</p>
                     <p>Our rational Faculty is injur'd either by being diminiſh'd or aboliſh'd, as by Stupidity and Folly; or by being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, as in Deliriums, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <head>ART. I. <hi>Of the defect of Memory, and Stupidity.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>OUR Reaſon is impair'd or extinguiſh'd by the defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of Memory, which is an Endowment common to us with Beaſts, and is generally affected by the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of the Head. The remote Cauſes that prejudice the Memory may be reduc'd to three Claſſes. 1. Whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver alters the regular form of the Brain, its Pores and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages; as Falls, Bruiſes, Wounds, or any preternatural
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:207638:267" rendition="simple:additions"/>form of the Head. 2. Whatever corrupts the Blood and Animal Spirits; as immoderat Drinking, unſeaſonable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, ſtopping of any wonted Evacuation of Blood, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Bleeding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. Whatever exhauſts, diſperſes, or ſtupifies the Spirits; as an indiſcreet uſe of Opium, Poyſon, Love-Potions, exceſſive Venery, ſudden Fear, Care and Watchings, and exceſs and multiplicity of Studies, ſleepy Diſeaſes, Epilepſies, Apoplexies, Madneſs, acute Feavers, the Plague, and old Age.</p>
                        <p>A natural want of Memory being incurable, dos not fall within the compaſs of our preſent inquiry. If it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternaturally occaſion'd, we ought to conſider the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and paſt life of the Patient. If the Perſon be old, drouſy, and inclin'd to ſleep much, and voids a great deal of Phlegm by the Mouth and Noſtrils, but retains a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Judgment, we will find that in his Youth he was not given to ſtudy, or perplex'd with Buſineſs and Care; and that the loſs of Memory proceeds from an inundation of Lymph in the Brain. Old Perſons whoſe Youth was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in much ſtudy and thought, have generally a dry habit of Body, void but little by the Mouth or Noſe, ſleep not much, and are eaſily wakened: and their want of Memory proceeds from the dryneſs of the Brain, and agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Spirits. If young Perſons are ſeiz'd with a loſs or deficiency of Memory, whoſe Apprehenſion and Genius was and continues lively, it argues a dryneſs occaſion'd in the Brain by the nimble Revolutions of the Spirits; and generally ſuch Perſons are in danger of loſing both Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Memory when they grow old. And thoſe whoſe Memory and Judgment are very freſh and keen in their Youth, are apt to run the ſame riſque. If a Youth have a weak Memory, and withal a drouſy inactive Temper, 'tis owing to the Humidity of the Brain, and Deficiency of Animal Spirits.</p>
                        <p>The ſudden loſs of Memory without any viſible Cauſe, is a Forerunner of an Apoplexy, Palſy or Epilepſy. If it ſurpriſe one already enfeebled and weak, 'tis a ſign of Death. If it ariſe from the moiſture of the Brain, 'tis eaſier cur'd, than when it flows from an exceſſive dryneſs. If it be caus'd by Poiſon, Love-potions, inveterat Diſeaſes of the Head, malignant and acute Feavers, 'tis almoſt incurable.</p>
                        <p>As for the Cure. The remote Cauſes muſt be ſpecially accounted for: If it proceed from a dryneſs of the Brain, aromatic and ſpirituous Medicines are very noxious; nor
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:207638:268"/>are there any Medicines ſo effectual, as moiſt and juicy Food, Milk, Chocolate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If it ariſe from the Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the Brain, attended by a ſtupidity and drouſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Spirits, Purgatives are firſt proper, then Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics, ſneezing Pouders, and Medicines to be chew'd.</p>
                        <p>The aromatic Medicines are Roſemary, Baum, Stechas, Spike, and all the Spices. Three Cubebs taken in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a faſting ſtomac, corroborat the Memory wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. Cardamoms are very good, but more proper for old than young Perſons. Frankincenſe and Amber are likewiſe very uſeful. But above all, Ambergreaſe is the moſt powerful Medicine. 'Tis given in Pouder with Sugar, or by way of Eſſence or Tincture prepar'd with Spirit of Roſes or black Cherries. It ought to be given in a ſmall Doſe, by reaſon of a Stupidity that ſometimes follows it. Where the Brain is dry, or the Patient young and of a hot Conſtitution, 'tis not proper. But for old People 'tis incomparable, if diſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly us'd. Beſides, 'tis an incentive to Venery, which is a mortal Enemy to the Memory.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Laurembergius</hi> recommends the four following Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for corroborating the Memory, which are chiefly to be us'd when the Brain is moiſt, and the Spirits drouſy.</p>
                        <p>Take of juicy Tobacco-leaves two handfuls; Roots of Pellitory of <hi>Spain</hi> three Drams; Ginger a Dram. With Hony reduce 'em to the conſiſtence of a Pultice, and make little round Balls to be chew'd or roll'd to and again in the Mouth.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Herbs, Baum, Marjoram, Sage and Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, Bay-leaves, of each a handful; Flowers of Laven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Lilly Convally, Lime-tree, and French Lavender, of each a little handful. Boil them in Spaniſh or Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Wine, and waſh the Head with the Decoction every fourth, fifth, or ſixth day.</p>
                        <p>Take a convenient quantity of Spaniſh Wine, in which macerat for fourteen or fifteen days the following Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents: Take of the Herbs, Baſil, Marjoram, Sage, Baum and Penny-Royal, of each half a handful; Flowers of Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, of Sage and Primroſes, Flowers of Roſemary, of French Lavender, and of Lilly Convally, of each a little handful. Diſtil thro an Alembic, and receive the Spirit in a large open Body, which ſet into a heap of large black Ants, ſuch as reſort to reſinous Trees. When four or five handfuls of Ants have crept into it, ſtir them with a ſtick till they be all ſtifled. Then ſet 'em to digeſt for fourteen
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:207638:268"/>days in the Sun, and after that draw off the Spirit, and infuſe into it of the Confection of <hi>Anacardium,</hi> Cinnamom, of each an Ounce; Saffron half a Dram; Moſch twelve Grains. Mix, digeſt and ſtrain out the Spirit; of which exhibit a ſpoonful in a Glaſs of Wine every Morning.</p>
                        <p>Take of Tobacco-leaves two handfuls; Flowers of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Baſil, of Baum, of Primroſes, and of Marjoram, of each a handful. Bruiſe 'em, and mix with Oil of Olives and freſh Butter, of each three Ounces; Rheniſh or Spaniſh Wine five Ounces: boil for a Liniment to be ſtrain'd and applied to the Temple and top of the Head.</p>

                        <p>THE Depravation of the Rational Faculty is call'd a <hi>Delirium</hi> or Doating, which ſometimes ſeizes the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion alone, and at other times reaches to all the three Operations of the Intellect together. The immediat Cauſe is the diſorder of the Animal Spirits, in reſpect of their Subſtance and Motion; which occaſions varions <hi>Deliriums</hi> according to the Humour and Conſtitution of the Patient; as one and the ſame Wine fills one Man with Anger and Fury, a ſecond with Mirth and Jollity, and inſpires a third with Love.</p>
                        <p>The remote Cauſes are either external, as narcotic Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, poiſonous or mad Animals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which more anon: or internal, as Feavers, Melancoly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe internal Cauſes determin the Animal Spirits to ſuch and ſuch particular Motions, after the ſame manner as the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillation of the Genital Liquor occaſions particular Dreams and nocturnal Pollutions.</p>

                        <p>WHEN a violent Feaver attends a <hi>Delirium,</hi> 'tis call'd a Phrenſy; or if the <hi>Delirium</hi> be not very high, a <hi>Paraphrenitis.</hi> If it be quite free from a Feaver, we call it a melancholic Madneſs.</p>
                        <div type="part">
                           <head>Of Phrenſies.</head>
                           <p>THE immediat Cauſe is the confus'd and rapid Motion of the Spirits in the Brain, eſpecially in the <hi>Corpus Callo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum.</hi> The remote Cauſes are either the Heat and Efferveſcency, or the Stagnation of the Blood in the Brain. In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of burning Feavers, the former occaſions the Agility and Perturbation of the Spirits; and conſequently the Watchings and light <hi>Deliriums</hi> that then moleſt the Patient. (If theſe Symptoms happen without a notorious Efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, 'tis a fatal ſign of Malignity.) The latter inflames the Membrans and Cortical Part, and ſo cauſes a Phrenſy, properly ſo call'd. This Inflammation is made to appear by diffecting Phrenitic Perſons after death; and is juſtly ſuſpected when Pleuriſies and Inflammations of the Lungs or any external Inflammations, diſappear of a ſudden, and are ſucceeded by Phrenſies.</p>
                           <p>The remote Cauſes are exceſſive Heat, drinking of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous Liquors, ſuppreſſion of any uſual Evacuation of Blood, or of a virulent Gonorrhy, Anger, and the exalted Paſſions of the Mind.</p>
                           <p>It ought to be remark'd, that tho all Phrenſies are attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Feavers, they do not always proceed from the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as in malignant Feavers, where the Blood do's not boil high. Sportive ridiculous Phrenſies ought to be carefully diſtinguiſh'd from thoſe of a ſerious, angry, and eager Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. According to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> the former are of a more benign Stamp than the latter.</p>
                           <p>As for the Symptoms. An actual <hi>Delirium</hi> is eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd. An imminent <hi>Delirium</hi> is diſcover'd by a ſudden al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the Patient's Humour, a bold, fierce way of talking much, unquietneſs and toſſing in Bed; the nauſeous repetition of one thing, or forgetfulneſs of what was ſaid or done; obſtinat Watching, or the interruption and uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:207638:270"/>of ſleep. When the <hi>Delirium</hi> has actually ſeiz'd upon 'em, they become moroſe and furious, leap out of Bed, and talk ſtrangely; the Urine is at firſt thick, and in a little time after grows thin and tranſparent; the Head feels hot; the Eyes look glittering, fiery, and very moveable. (If they appear ſtiff and ſtaring, 'tis an infallible ſign of a furious Phrenſy.) If in the beginning of an acute Diſeaſe, the Perſon complain of a pain of the Eye-balls, or an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the Eyes, or be apt to imagin ſtrange Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, 'tis a fatal Preſage of Doating and Convulſions.</p>
                           <p>A proper Phrenſy which proceeds from the Inflammation of the Membrans of the Brain, is foreſeen from the violent beating of the Arteries in the Neck and Temples. It is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by an unſufferable Pain of the hinder part of the Head; a difficult Reſpiration; an invincible Heat, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Feaver free from the ſenſe of Thirſt; a proneneſs to rub and toſs the Head, and pull up the Hairs. When the Inflammation relents, it tends to a Gangrene, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions Convulſions, Lethargies, and a total inactivity.</p>
                           <p>A true Phrenſy proceeding from the Inflammation of the Brain is very dangerous. If it increaſe after ſleeping; if it be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and fierce; if a clammy cold Sweat drop from the Head, while the Body is unconcern'd; if it be attended by a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Reſpiration, immoderat Watching, Headaches, notable Weakneſs, a ghaſtly Countenance, an invincible Forgetfulneſs, a Hiccough, gnaſhing of the Teeth, trembling of the Tongue and Hands, and involuntary voiding of Excrements; if the Perſon he ſpeechleſs, apt to gather up or pick the Bed-cloaths, or become lethargic; if the Noſtrils drop, and the Urine be not tinctur'd: All theſe Symptoms portend Death. A <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphrenitis,</hi> proceeding only from the Heat and Efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of the Blood and Spirits, is more tolerable.</p>
                           <p>A Symptornatical Phrenſy is a proper Subject of Cure; but a Critical one ought not to be meddled with. It is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd for the moſt part by bleeding at the Noſe, and is diſtinguiſh'd by the following Symptoms. The Urine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords ſigns of Concoction; the Pulſe is unequal, but ſtrong and large; the Eyes ſparkle, a murmuring Noiſe diſturbs the Ears, the Noſtrils itch, the Face is red, and the lower Belly ſoftly diſtended. Sometimes 'tis uſher'd in by a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Headache; or the ſick Perſon is young and apt to bleed at the Noſe. If theſe Symptoms are wanting, the Phrenſy is ſymptomatical, and ought to be cur'd by allaying the Heat and Turgency of the Blood and Spirits, or removing the Stagnation.</p>
                           <pb n="539" facs="tcp:207638:270"/>
                           <p>In the firſt place let the Phyſician take care that he be not impos'd upon by drunken Perſons, whoſe Phrenſies reſemble thoſe of Feavers. In the next place, if the phrentic Perſon be moleſted with Head-aches and immoderat Watchings, Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotic Medicines are very proper, but ought to be cautiouſly adminiſtred, for fear of exalting the Phrenſy, or convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it into a Lethargy. In order to avoid ſuch Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, let us take notice of the following Cautions. 1. That in acute hot Diſeaſes, Opiats ought to be prepar'd with Vinegar. 2. That they ought not to be adminiſtred in the beginning or height of the Diſtemper, but only during its increaſe. 3. That when the Perſon is very weak, they ſhould be omitted. 4. They ought ſtill to be mix'd with Bezoardic, Diaphoretic Pouders.</p>
                           <p>Blood-letting is always convenient, unleſs the Feaver be very malign; and ought to be liberally perform'd, and in the following manner. 1. Let a Vein in the Hams be firſt open'd; then in the Arm; and afterwards in the Forehead. Incaſe of a particular Suppreſſion of Blood in the lower Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, let the Vein in the Ancle be firſt open'd. Inſtead of breathing the Vein in the Forehead, ſome recommend the Application of ſcarify'd Cupping-glaſſes to the forepart of the Head. 2. Let the Surgeon, while the Vein is open, lay his hand upon the Patient's Head, and mind the beating of the Artery, in order to adjuſt the quantity of Blood to be drawn forth, and the ſtrength of the Patient. 3. Let the Orifice of the Vein be ſtop'd and open'd by turns by the Surgeon's Finger. Thus the ſtagnating Blood is evacuated without impairing the ſtrength of the Patient in ſo great a meaſure as otherwiſe.</p>
                           <p>As for external Applications, all ſtrong ſmelling things, except Camphyr, ought to be avoided; Vinegar muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but in ſmall quantities, becauſe its ſharpneſs hinders ſleep.</p>
                           <p>A ſymptomatical Phrenſy diſappears upon the removal of the principal Diſeaſe. Cooling and narcotic Medicines are its proper Cure; to which Diaphoretic Febrifuga's are join'd according to the Degree and Circumſtances of the Feaver.</p>
                           <p>Take of the Waters of Male Pimpernel, Purſlain, and white Water-Lillies, of each an Ounce and a half; Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of Water-Lillies, and Syrup of Poppies, of each ſix Drams.</p>
                           <p>The Acid Mineral Spirits of Vitriol, Salt, Sulphur, dulcify'd Spirit of Nitre, and dulcify'd Spirit of Salt, are very uſeful againſt Phrenſies. Camphyr has a peculiar
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:207638:271"/>pacific Virtue. If it be added to Opiats, their Doſe ought to be proportionably leſſen'd: As,</p>
                           <p>Take of the Conſerve of red Poppy-flowers vitriolated half a Dram; <hi>Langelot</hi>'s <hi>Laudanum Opiatum</hi> one Grain; Camphyr two Grains. Mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Sugar of Lead prepar'd with Spirit of Nitre is a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Pacific. The Decoction of the Flowers of Male Pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernel in Water, whetted with a little Rheniſh Wine, is of excellent uſe.</p>
                           <p>Take of the four great Cold-ſeeds, of each a Dram and a half; white Poppy-ſeeds three Drams. With Purſlain-water make an Emulſion. To which add human Scull pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd without Fire half a Dram; Bezoar Mineral a Scruple; Syrup of Purſlain half an Ounce. Mix for uſe.</p>
                           <p>In a malignant Phrenſy let the following Pouder be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, <hi>viz.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Take of Cinnabar of Antimony twelve or fifteen Grains; Lunar Bezoar ſix or eight Grains; Laudanum Opiatum a Grain; Camphyr two Grains. Make a Pouder for two Doſes to be exhibited in the Emulſion of white Poppy-ſeeds made with Pimpernel and Purſlain Water. Or,</p>
                           <p>Take of the Cephalic Specific Pouder a Scruple; Sugar of Lead ſix Grains; Camphyr two Grains; Laudanum Opia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum a Grain and a half.</p>
                           <p>Acid Juleps are likewiſe very proper; and if the Belly be conſtipated, Tamarinds may be boil'd in 'em.</p>
                           <p>Externally let Cataplaſms of Rue, Chamomile, Vervain, Briony-roots and Soap; or of Radiſhes, Salt, ſharp Vinegar and Yeſt, be applied to the ſoles of the Feet. Or,</p>
                           <p>Take of the Juice of Houſeleek new drawn ſix Drams; ſharp Wine Vinegar an Ounce and a half; Nitre two Drams; Camphyr half a Dram. Mix, and apply to the Stones, ſoles of the Feet, and forepart of the Head. When the Perſon ſleeps, it ought to be taken off the Head.</p>
                           <p>A Cataplaſm of Houſeleek, Purſlain and Roſes, may be applied to the Temples and Forehead. The Pulp of a Gourd applied to the Head ſhav'd is commended by <hi>Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let.</hi> Some ſet their Feet into an excavated Gourd, and find benefit by it. The Juice of live River-Crabs newly expreſs'd is applied to the Forehead with wonderful ſucceſs. Or,</p>
                           <p>Take of Roſe-water ten Ounces; Opium a Dram; Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron half a Scruple. Mix them, and apply with a doubled Linen Cloth to the Forehead.</p>
                           <pb n="541" facs="tcp:207638:271"/>
                           <p>Take of the Water of Frogs Spaun ſix or eight Ounces; freſh Juice of River-Crabs, two, three or four Ounces; Opium diſſolv'd in Vinegar half a Dram or two Scruples; Camphyr and Saffron, of each ſix, eight or ten Grains. Mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or,</p>
                           <p>Take of the Juice of River-Crabs, extracted with the Water of Frogs Spawn, ſix Ounces; Vinegar of Roſes two Ounces; Triacle of Andromachus two Drams; Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyr half a Scruple; Saffron ſix Grains. Mix, and foment the Head and Temples. Let the Liquor be lukewarm or ſomewhat cold.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Lindanus</hi> attributes much to the antient way of applying live Creatures, cut up along the middle, as a Dove, a Cock, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the Head ſhav'd: But in the firſt beginning of a Phrenſy they rather enforce it.</p>
                           <p>Oftimes the phrentic Perſons, thro inadvertency, neglect to void their Urine; in which caſe, Take of Pellitory of the Wall two handfuls; of Parſley (the whole Herb) one handful. Boil them in Water. Bruiſe them into a Pulp, and with two Ounces of Oil of Scorpions make a Cataplaſm to be applied to the Pubes.</p>
                           <p>Or, Let the Pubes and Perinaeum be fomented; and then anointed with the following Liniment, <hi>viz.</hi> Take of Cony Fat, or Ointment of Marſhmallows an Ounce; Oil of Scorpions half an Ounce. Mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                              <hi>Of Melancolic</hi> Deliriums.</head>
                           <p>THE Doatings of Melancoly are free from a Feaver. They ought to be heedfully diſtinguiſh'd from the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancoly it ſelf, which is a principal Diſeaſe ariſing from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Cauſes, attended by a ſorrowful, fullen, peeviſh, penſive Humour, an unaccountable Straitneſs and Anxiety of the Breaſt, a proneneſs to Anger, and a facility of being frighted: Whereas thoſe are for the moſt part occaſion'd by external Cauſes. The Epithet of Melancoly is join'd to them, not as if Melancoly and Grief were inſeparable Companions, for ſome are merry and ſportive; but becauſe they proceed from a vicious fix'd acid Humour, which the Antients call'd Melancoly.</p>
                           <p>All Perſons ſeiz'd with this ſort of Doating, have pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Symptoms and Humours according to the variety of their Objects, and the manner in which they are carried
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:207638:272"/>out in purſuit of 'em. But in general they all jump in the following Particulars.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. The Mind and Thought are always confin'd to one Object, or one Set of Objects. 2. Fear and Anxiety ſtill haunt them: tho they imagin themſelves rich, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſeem to be tickl'd with the Fancy; yet ſtill the Joy is but ſhort-liv'd, and Fear, Vexation and Trouble fill its room. 3. They all ſleep little or none at all; or if they happen to ſleep, are ſtill haunted with fearful Dreams, and ſcaring Phantaſms. 4. All of 'em have their lucid Intervals. 5. The Diſeaſe is more apt to diſappear or remit upon ſome ſudden alteration of Diet, or any other ſuch occaſional Cauſe, than by all the force and application of Art. 6. The Source of the Diſeaſe is always ſeated in the lower Belly. Upon which account Vomiting is the moſt ſovereign Remedy. 7. The Cure never ſucceeds without abating the immoderat Watchings. 8. Fooliſh <hi>Deliriums</hi> are ofttimes cur'd by fooliſh Remedies, which ſerve only to rectify the Fancy; as a Man imagining Serpents to be in his Belly, was cur'd by conveying Serpents into his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, and giving him occaſion to think that they were voided by himſelf. We may read a great many ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, in <hi>Thonerus, Platerus, Foreſtus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>The Seat is referable only to the Imagination or Fancy, which receives the Ideas of Objects convey'd thro the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Senſes, and ſtamp'd upon the Spirits. Now if theſe Animal Spirits degenerat from their lucid temperat Quality, and perform uncouth, awkward Motions, the rational Soul muſt needs conſequently entertain it ſelf with ſutable Ideas.</p>
                           <p>Tho this kind of Delirium be different from Melancoly it ſelf, yet it do's not invade any but ſuch as have a Melanco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſition of the Blood and Spirits; which by the way is the true reaſon why it do's not always follow, where its ordinary Cauſes take place.</p>
                           <p>Suppoſe we then that a melancoly Perſon meets with an Object which is extreamly agreeable or diſagreeable to him; and is forcibly ſtamp'd upon the mind by the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of ſome violent Paſſion, Love, Grief, Fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if a Hypocondriac Perſon be moleſted with a murmuring noiſe in the Guts, reſembling the croking of Frogs: This fills him with fear and amazement: It determines the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to new Paſſages which they are unwilling to forſake: The Idea of the frightful Noiſe ſtill haunts his thoughts, till at length by the repeated and continu'd Rack, and inuring
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:207638:272"/>the Spirits to that unwonted particular Motion of Thought, the Rational Soul is brought into a habit of entertaining and dwelling upon that Subject; and ſo the Perſon is inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly wrought into the fix'd Opinion that Frogs are lodg'd in his Belly. Now that the Spirits being forcibly driven into new Channels are apt to perſiſt in the ſame courſe, and are unwilling to return to their wonted Devoirs, is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made out by the Influence of Paſſion, or any weighty Concern upon Watchings, or the Dreams of ſleeping Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which is only owing to the proneneſs of the Spirits to retain the ſame new Paſſages, as the preceding Buſineſs, and the Commotion it occaſion'd had ſo effectually cut out for 'em. The verity of this advance may be likewiſe evinc'd by the many Inſtances of Perſons liable to this Diſtemper.</p>
                           <p>The Doating that follows Melancoly being thus account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, our next buſineſs is to offer the Cauſes of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coly it ſelf. They are either external or internal. The former are ſuch Objects as are apt to occaſion violent Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which immediatly diſorder the Spirits, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Blood and firſt Digeſtion. The latter are ſuch Circumſtances of Diet and way of living as alter the Juices of the Body, which impart the reſpective quality to the Blood and Spirits.</p>
                           <p>This Conſtitution of the Blood and Spirits is ofttimes natural and hereditary, ariſing from the nature of the Seed; for ſo much as moſt of our Humours and Propenſity to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Paſſions is owing to the natural Idio-ſincraſy of the Blood and Spirits.</p>
                           <p>All melancoly Diſpoſitions that have a tendency to Doat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, owe their immediat Original to ſome vicious Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or Digeſtion in the firſt Paſſages. The remote Cauſes may be ſometimes external, ſometimes internal; but they never reach the length of Doating, till they have ſtamp'd a vicious Character on the Belly and its Entrails. Some ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine a Chymeric Melancoly proceeding eſſentially from the Head; but if they view the matter throughly, they'l find cauſe to acknowledg their Error.</p>
                           <p>'Tis uſual to aſcribe Melancoly to the Spleen: And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in melancolic Conſtitutions the Spleen may be damag'd by the Stagnation of the Blood in the Arteries, and may ſerve to exaſperat the Diſeaſe: it being a part enrich'd with good ſtore of Nerves, and communicating with the wandring and intercoſtal Pair, cannot well miſs of being prejudic'd by the membranous Convulſions that Hypocondriac Perſons are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:207638:273"/>to. But originally the Spleen is faultleſs, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Cauſe muſt needs be a vicious Acid bred in the firſt Paſſages, that thickens the Blood, and deſtroys its due Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation. This is evinc'd both by the Symptoms and Method of Cure. The former are a voracious Appetite, a conſtipated Belly, and Acid Belchings; the viſible Effects of an Acid ſculking in the Stomac or firſt Paſſages. As for the Cure, it turns upon abſorbent Anti-acid Medicines.</p>
                           <p>The Blood thus perverted by the prevailing Acid, ſtands accountable for the difficult Reſpiration, beating of the Heart, and the like Symptoms. It is not ſo productive of volatil lucid Spirits as otherwiſe; upon which account they become ſtiff and more fix'd, and conſequently apt either to move irregularly in the Brain, or ſtill to retain the ſame courſe of Motion. In the former caſe the Doatings are wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring and undetermin'd. In the latter, the whole force and vigour of Thought is confin'd to one Object, ſo that ofttimes the melancoly Perſons are enabled to diſcourſe and reaſon about it with much more accuracy than in their healthy ſtate, when other Objects claim a larger ſhare in their Thoughts, and cramp their Application to that one. Oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the ſick Perſon reaſons calmly on any other Object be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide that of his Melancoly, by reaſon that the Spirits are not ſo keen and eager in purſuing the former.</p>
                           <p>The change of Air and Seaſons, or of any <hi>not natural thing,</hi> ſenſibly alters the <hi>Craſis</hi> of the Blood and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and conſequently the nature of this <hi>Delirium,</hi> either by quite extinguiſhing, or heightning, or depreſſing it; or by removing it from one Object to another: As Wine by altering the ſtate of the Blood and Spirits, firſt makes ſome Men cheerful, then inſpires 'em with a talkative Humour; afterwards diſpoſes 'em to Strife, Anger, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and laſt of all, covers 'em with drouſineſs and ſleep.</p>
                           <p>Melancoly being grounded on the Conſtitution of the Blood and Spirits, becomes an inveterat Companion, and ofttimes propagates it ſelf by an hereditary Succeſſion, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially among Women, who convey the Legacy to their Daughters, that ſurely viſits 'em when with Child, or upon point of delivery, if not at other times.</p>
                           <p>It is ofttimes cur'd by the Stratagem of cheating the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient into a contrary Humour or Paſſion; which if forcible and ſtrong, recals the Spirits from the Paſſages in which they deviate.</p>
                           <pb n="545" facs="tcp:207638:273"/>
                           <p>'Tis highly neceſſary to obviat Melancoly betimes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its Settlement. Now a melancolic Diſpoſition is uſher'd in by theſe Signs. The Perſon is troubled in ſleep, and haunted by aukward Dreams; he becomes fullen and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful, and courts ſolitude; he is penſive, and apt to dwell long upon one thought; and is timorous to a high degree. If he begin to tell ridiculous Stories, and withal is full of his own Wiſdom, the <hi>Delirium</hi> is at hand.</p>
                           <p>Let the Cauſes be diligently inquir'd after. If it proceed from the Paſſions of the Mind, the Pulſe is low, inconſtant, contracted, ofttimes unequal, and ſometimes reſembles the Motion of Emmets or Worms; and when the Mind is unbend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by chearfulneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Pulſe is proportionably alter'd.</p>
                           <p>If Melancoly ſteal on by degrees, without the influence of external Objects, and be follow'd by wandring unfix'd <hi>Deliriums,</hi> it proceeds from the Hypochondriac Diſtemper; and is attended by the Palpitation of the Heart, Anxiety of the Breaſt, acid Belchings, a murmuring noiſe in the Guts, conſtipation of the Belly, Wind, an uneaſy obſcure Pain in the left ſide of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> with a Pulſation in the ſame place, or in the Back, a notable heat in the Forehead, and wandring Inflammations over the Body.</p>
                           <p>If it proceed immediatly from the Depravation of the Blood, it remits now and then; the Patient is querulods and anxious, oppreſs'd with Grief and Sorrow, and a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Palpitation of the Heart.</p>
                           <p>If Melancoly be caus'd by Paſſions of the Mind, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Objects, 'tis much more eaſily cur'd than when it ows its Original to the internal Indiſpoſition of the Blood and Spirits. If it be follow'd by Doting, recur frequently, or claim a hereditary Privilege, it accompanies the Perſon to the Grave. If it be occaſion'd by preceding Diſeaſes, as Feavers, Phrenſies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a regular Diet carries it off. It is more uncommon among Women than among Men; yet the Cure of the former is more difficult, eſpecially if they be with Child, or paſs'd the ſeaſon of their Terms. If the Countenance be chearful: If the <hi>Delir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If the Perſon be ſubject to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth Laughter or Crying, immoderat Grief attended by a ſort of Fury, it tends to a Palſy or Apoplexy, or Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. If he obſtinatly decline eating or drinking, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally

                           <p>We are now arriv'd at the Method of Cure, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in rectifying the Blood and Spirits by proper Correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and reducing the Animal to orderly Motions. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Remarks are worthy our obſervation upon this matter.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. The remote Cauſe muſt be taken off either by moral Perſwaſions, or deceiving the Perſon with ſome cunning Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem, ſo as to bring him off the melancolic Fancy. If the Cauſe be internal, as ſuppreſſion of the Terms, the hypocondri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac Diſeaſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it muſt be particularly taken care of. In gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral the hypocondriac Specifics and comforting Cephalic Medicines are always proper. 2. Vomiting is an eſſential part of the Cure, and ought to be frequently repeated. 3. Let the Phyſician be very cautious in viſiting the Patients alone, for they hate the Perſon that pretends to cure 'em, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Odium even after they are cur'd. 4. When the melancolic Fancy is deeply lodg'd within 'em, they ought to be undeceiv'd by the means of ſome Stratagem or Trick. 5. By all means the Belly muſt be kept open: If it do not anſwer every day of it ſelf, let Clyſters or lenitive Draughts provoke it. 6. During the Solſtices and Equinoxes, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ought to ply proper Preſervatives, for fear of the Relap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which are wont to happen at thoſe times. 7. Blood-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is improper, excepting the Caſe of Suppreſſions, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations and Plethora's, or where Madneſs is fear'd. <hi>Willis</hi> fancies that when the old unactive Blood is drawn forth, it gives occaſion to the Generation of new ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Blood; but he ſhould have remembred that 'tis Blood that begets Blood, and that by Blood letting, Stupidity and dull Folly is promoted. Trepanations, Iſſues, and bliſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Plaiſters are ſometimes us'd with Succeſs. 8. In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Diſeaſe, Purgatives may ſucceed to Vomits: but in the progreſs of the Diſtemper they are very improper. Dieuretics are incomparable Medicines for this Diſeaſe. Melancolic People naturally void large quantities of Urine; and its deep Tincture, muddineſs or blackneſs, betokens the declenſion of the Diſtemper. 10. The <hi>Hypochondria</hi> muſt be particularly taken care of in all ſorts of Melancolies. 11. By all means let Sleep be promoted by moiſt temperat Food, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 12. Opiats ought not to be exhibited alone, nor before the Acid in the Stomac be remov'd by the univerſal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuations. They ought to be mix'd with Specific and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening Ingredients. Externally Anodyn Fomentations for the Head, Waſhes for the Feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are very proper.
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:207638:274"/>13. Their Diet muſt be very regular. Their Food nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, moiſt, and temperat, as Milk, Raiſins, Apples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A Glaſs of generous Wine is very proper now and then; a moderat Exerciſe and the regular Evacuation of Excrements ought to be heedfully procur'd.</p>
                           <p>Now of the Medicines anſwering the foreſaid intentions, Antimony is the chief both in its vomiting and purgative Capacity; but eſpecially the former. This and all other Emetics muſt be given in very large Doſes, tho it is proper to begin with the ordinary one, and from thence advance gradually. The Flowers of Antimony, <hi>Aurum Vitae,</hi> the Infuſion of <hi>Mercurius Vitae, Sylvius</hi>'s vomitory Soap, and <hi>Sala</hi>'s Emetic Syrup are all uſeful: As,</p>
                           <p>Take of Fumitory Water one Ounce; Gum Ammoniac diſſolv'd in Wine, from a Scruple to half a Dram; Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Syrup a Dram and a half; Scammony ſulphurated, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of Troches Alhandal, of each one Grain; Simple Syrup of Roſes two Drams. Mix for a Potion.</p>
                           <p>The Doſe of Purgatives muſt be likewiſe augmented or ſharpned with Salts: As,</p>
                           <p>Take of Extract of black Hellebor a Scruple; Extract of Troches Alhandal two Grains; Purgative Antimony, or <hi>Mercurius Vitae,</hi> five Grains. With Eſſence of Steel, or Tincture of Tartar, make Pills. Or, if a Potion be more acceptable, with the Waters of Pimpernel, or of Flowers of St. <hi>John</hi>'s-wort, make a Potion, and ſweeten it with laxative Syrup of Apples.</p>
                           <p>The Troches Alhandal are of incomparable uſe for ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the viſcid matter, that reigns in this and all other Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Diſtempers.</p>
                           <p>Take of Extract of black Hellebor, ſweet Mercury, of each a Scruple; Magiſtery of Jalap ſix Grains: with Gum Ammoniac diſſolv'd in Vinegar, make Pills.</p>
                           <p>Take of Mint-water one Ounce; Liquid Extract of Steel half a Dram; Extract of black Hellebor a Scruple; Extract of Troches Alhandal one Grain; Syrup of Apples half an Ounce. Mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Take of Mint-water one Ounce; Gum Ammoniac diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd in Vinegar a Scruple, or half a Dram; Tartar vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triolated half a Scruple; Extract of Troches Alhandal one Grain; Syrup of Apples half an Ounce. Mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Take of pick'd Senna two or three Drams; Roots of Polypody three or four Drams; Roots of black Hellebor one or two Drams; Salt of Tartar half a Dram. Infuſe
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:207638:275"/>them warm in clarify'd Whey over night. In the Morning let 'em boil gently; and add to three Ounces of the ſtrain'd Liquor, a Dram and a half of Cinnamom Water; and three, four or ſix Drams of Syrup of Apples. Or,</p>
                           <p>Take of Corants bruis'd three Ounces; pick'd Senna ſix Drams; choice Cinnamom three Drams; Cloves a Dram and a half; Cream of Tartar three Drams. Bruiſe 'em and tie 'em in a Bag, to be infus'd for the ſpace of a night in three Pound of ſimple Water.</p>
                           <p>Take of Gum Ammoniac diſſolv'd in Vinegar five Grains; Tartar vitriolated three Grains; Extract of Gummy Aloe two Grains. With Eſſence of Gum Ammoniac make Pills.</p>
                           <p>Next to Hellebor and its Productions, are the Infuſions of Senna; <hi>Quercetanus</hi>'s Pills of Ammoniac, or of Tartar, of Fumitory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Abſorbent Digeſtives ought to precede the uſe of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; ſuch are Cream of Tartar, Vitriol of Steel, or its Tincture, Eſſence of Steel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or,</p>
                           <p>Take of prepar'd Crabs half a Dram; prepar'd red Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, Alterative Crocus of Steel, of each half a Scruple. Make a Pouder for two Doſes. Or,</p>
                           <p>Take of Sal Armoniac, Salt of Wormwood, and prepar'd Crabs eyes, of each fifteen Grains; Laudanum Opiatum two or three Grains. Make a Pouder for two Doſes.</p>
                           <p>Alteratives in this Diſeaſe either correct the Acidity of the Blood, or amend its Indiſpoſition, and purify it by Urine.</p>
                           <p>Of the former kind are Preparations of Steel, ſuch as its Infuſion and Extract, with the Juice of Apples; all the Aperitive Crocus's of Mars, <hi>Mynſicht</hi>'s Tincture of Steel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Lead alſo, but eſpecially its Sugar; Coral and its Preparations, and chiefly its true Tincture; in room of which, if it be wanting, you may take of the Tincture of Coral prepar'd with Spirit of Stag's Heart, or that of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, one Dram; Eſſence of Baum and Saffron, of each half a Dram. And mix 'em.</p>
                           <p>Of this ſort alſo is the true Tincture of Silver and its Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtery, either alone or mix'd with other Anti-acids, as Coral and ſuch like.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Mynſicht</hi>'s <hi>Arcanum Duplicatum</hi> is frequently us'd with good ſucceſs; likewiſe <hi>Lapis Lazuli,</hi> either in Pouder, or its Tincture mix'd as follows.</p>
                           <pb n="549" facs="tcp:207638:275"/>
                           <p>Take compound Eſſence of Pimpernel three Drams; Tincture of <hi>Lapis Lazuli</hi> a Dram. Doſe from forty to fifty Drops.</p>
                           <p>For altering and purifying the Blood by Urine, the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable Kingdom affords many excellent Remedies; amongſt which Tartar and its Preparations excel, as Cream of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar plain or vitriolated; or, mix'd with lixivial Salts; Spirit and volatil Salt of Tartar; <hi>Rhefeldius</hi>'s Diaphoretic Liquor of Tartar with Juices made thus.</p>
                           <p>Take of the expreſs'd Juices of Dittander four Ounces; Scurvy-graſs, Sea Radiſh, Water and Garden Creſſes, of each an Ounce; rectify'd Spirit of Tartar one pound. Mix and digeſt, and then diſtil in a Bath over a ſlow Fire. Doſe, half an Ounce.</p>
                           <p>Remedies alſo are prepar'd of Borrage, Bugloſs, Fumito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Saffron, Camphyr; which laſt ought always to be joined with Alteratives in melancolic and maniac Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. As, Take liquid Eſſence of Steel two Drams; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Eſſence of Fumitory, and that of Saffron, of each a Dram; Camphyr five Grains. Doſe, thirty or forty Drops. Or,</p>
                           <p>Take of the Leaves of Harts-tongue two handfuls; of Fumitory an handful and a half; Flowers of Borrage and Bugloſs, of each a handful; of Clove Gilly-flowers and Violets half a handful; Barks of Tamarisk and the Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, of each ſix Drams; Roots of Polypody or Elecampane, Filings of Steel, of each an Ounce; Cinnamom two Drams.

                           <p>Take of the Sugar of Lead, from five to nine Grains; Laudanum Opiatum two Grains; diſtill'd Oil of Camphyr three Grains, and make Pills.</p>
                           <p>The Spirit of Sal Armoniac is an incomparable Sudorific, eſpecially mix'd with an equal quantity of the Carminative Spirit.</p>

                           <p>THE Blood which in Melancoly abounds with a vitious Acidity, is oftentimes by an inteſtin and fermentative Commotion volatilized, and ſo acquiring an Acrimony, and furniſhing the Brain with Spirits ſutable, occaſions Madneſs, which is Melancoly arrived at the higheſt degree.</p>
                           <p>In Madneſs we may obſerve three Circumſtances; 1. A remarkable Fury and temerarious Boldneſs, hurrying one to attempt any thing tho never ſo cruel and tragical. 2. A prodigious Strength, able to break in pieces the ſtrongeſt things, and ſurpaſſing that of two or three Men. 3. A won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Sufferance of even the extreameſt Cold. It is alſo accompanied with moſt ſtubborn Watchings.</p>
                           <p>The Diſorder of the Stomach, <hi>Inteſtinum Duodenum,</hi> and Bowels under the ſhort Ribs, is the cauſe of the groſsneſs, thickneſs and vitious Acidity of the Blood, which is the immediat material Cauſe of Madneſs.</p>
                           <p>The formal Cauſe is the Spirits, which degenerating from their ſeminal and friendly Complexion, become of a ſharp, ſaline, and as it were ſulphureous acid Quality: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently being too too movable, and leſs capable to be check'd in their ordinary Motions, and withal penetrating every where by virtue of their pointed parts, they become the Cauſe of Reſtleſneſs, Watchings, Fury, extraordinary Strength, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This Diſeaſe is more incident to the Young than Old, to Men than to Women, but eſpecially to melancolic Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions.</p>
                           <p>If it proceed from internal Cauſes, it is an Evil of long continuance, and of difficult Cure; which tho it remit for ſome Months or Years, yet it often leaves Melancoly behind, which being eaſily exaſperated, returns with freſh Rage, and accompanies the Patient till Strength failing through Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:207638:276"/>Faſtings, and almoſt perpetual Movings, it kindly ſhuts up their miſerable Life.</p>
                           <p>In curing this Diſeaſe we muſt endeavour, 1. To mitigat the Fury, that the Patient may be the eaſier manag'd, and Medicines exhibited. 2. To remove the Diſtemper of the Blood and Spirits.</p>
                           <p>The firſt is excellently perform'd by ſtrong Vomits and frequent Bleeding. Preparations from Steel and Lead, joined with Anodine Medicines, correct the Blood and other Humors; as Remedies from Camphyr and Musk do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creat and reſtore the Spirits.</p>
                           <p>The Foundation therefore of the Cure muſt be laid by adminiſtring ſtrong and generous Vomits, not only in the beginning, but progreſs of the Diſeaſe: For this purpoſe the Antients us'd white Hellebor-roots with excellent ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. But it ought not to be given in ſubſtance.</p>
                           <p>Take of white Hellebor-roots, from half a Dram to a Dram; boil them in Wine till it become ſoft: infuſe the Root thus prepar'd in freſh Wine all night in a hot place; ſtrain the Liquor, or ſqueeze more or leſs, according to the meaſure of its deſired ſtrength. Doſe, a Dram.</p>
                           <p>Some inſtead of this uſe Infuſions of Antimonial Emetics, but they prove too weak. <hi>Morcurius Vitae</hi> is good: <hi>Aurum Vitae Kegleri</hi> is much commended; alſo the Leaves of Aſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabacca: but all theſe muſt be given in a greater Doſe than ordinary. As,</p>
                           <p>Take of the Conſerve of the Leaves of Aſarabacca, a Dram, Pouder of its Roots two Scruples; <hi>Mercurius Vitae</hi> one Grain: make a Bolus.</p>
                           <p>The Infuſion of human Nails, is alſo a ſtrong Emetic, ſurpaſſing thoſe of Antimony.</p>

                           <p>But while theſe things are a doing, ſuch Alteratives are to be given, as may reſtrain the boiling and wild Motion of the Blood and Spirits, and together with theſe Opiats and ſulphureous Minerals and fix'd Anodines, and that in a ſtrong Doſe.</p>
                           <p>Such altering Remedies as we preſcrib'd for Melancoly, may be us'd here. Particularly thoſe from Tartar, Steel, Lead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But withal Nitre and its Preparations are not to be neglected. As,</p>

                           <p>Take purified Nitre two Scruples; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum</hi> two Grains. Make a Pouder.</p>
                           <p>We may alſo uſe appropriated Specifics, ſuch as the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious Blood of an Aſs, Pimpernel with the red Flowers, St. <hi>John</hi>'s-wort, Fumitory, Water-Lilly, Borrage, Baum, Spleen-wort, the Herb True-love, Polypody of the Oak; to all which Camphyr may be added. As,</p>
                           <p>Take a clean Linen Rag of a hands length and breadth, dip'd in Aſſes Blood, infuſe it in a ſufficient quantity of Water of St. <hi>John</hi>'s-wort: to two Ounces of the ſtrain'd Infuſion add Eſſence of Pimpernel half a Dram; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum</hi> about a Grain. Or,</p>

                        <head>ART. IV. <hi>Of</hi> Deliriums <hi>from an external Cauſe.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THIS Cauſe for the moſt part is the biting of ſome other Creature enrag'd with Anger, or taken with Madneſs. As in the caſe of a <hi>Canina Rabies,</hi> which is ſo called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis ofteneſt occaſioned by the biting of a mad Dog; tho the Infection may be deriv'd from any other Creature. For if any Creature chaf'd with Anger bites another, 'twill cauſe either Madneſs, or a very malignant and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Wound.</p>
                        <p>Theſe things relating to this Diſeaſe are moſt worthy our Obſervation, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The manner of Infection, which may be by the ſlighteſt bite or hurt of the mad Creature, or even the leaſt touch of its Spittle. 2. A <hi>Hydrophobia,</hi> or the fear of Water and other liquid things accompanies this Diſtemper. 3. The malign Contagion lies hid, and as it were aſleep in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſometimes two, three, or as ſome ſay, thirteen or twenty years. 4. In the Spittle and Urine of rabid Animals are often ſeen other ſmall Creatures, reſembling the Form of the firſt Authors of their Madneſs. And laſtly, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Creature exactly imitates the Actions and Meen of that which gave the Contagion.</p>
                        <p>The Cauſe of this Diſeaſe conſiſts in a certain peculiar Ferment, which affecting firſt the Spirits, and then the Blood, do's in ſome ſort aſſimilat 'em to thoſe of the furious Creature. This Ferment is carried along with the Saliva into the Wound.</p>
                        <p>It is of importance to know whether the Creature by which a Man has been bitten, be mad or not, in order to prevention: the manner of the Diſcovery is this; apply and rub upon the Wound Crum of Bread, till it is impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with the moiſture, and if a Dog will neither eat nor ſmell to it, or dies if he does, 'tis a ſign the Creature was mad.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes this Diſeaſe is accompany'd with a Feaver, and ſometimes not: The Signs that attend its beginning are, an anxious heavineſs of Heart; Anger without a manifeſt Cauſe;
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:207638:278"/>complaining of the offenſiveneſs of the Ambient Air; heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Signs of a perfect Rabies are, Convulſive Diſtenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Members; a bloated Face; anguiſh of Heart; frothing at Mouth; frightful Eyes; barking like a Dog, or otherwiſe aping the infecting Animal; reſtleſneſs, perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Watching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but eſpecially an <hi>Hydrophobia,</hi> or ſhrinking at the ſight of any Liquor.</p>
                        <p>If taken at the beginning, it may be cur'd with proper Remedies; but if it is come to perfection, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd with an <hi>Hydrophobia,</hi> it is an acute Diſtemper, which ſeldom admits of Cure, but brings Death the ſecond or third, or at moſt the fourth day from the Invaſion of this Symptom.</p>
                        <p>In the Cure of this fatal Diſtemper, two Periods of times are to be noted. 1. That of receiving the firſt Hurt or Wound. 2. That of the ſupervening Madneſs, and ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>Hydrophobia.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To begin with the latter: we muſt endeavour by all means to explode that venomous Ferment already poſſeſſing the Maſs of Blood. This muſt be done by internal Antidots, as well common as ſpecific: ſuch are Roots of Gentian and Swallow-wort; <hi>Galen</hi>'s Mad-wort, Rue, St. <hi>John</hi>'s-wort, Pimpernel, <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> Fuller's Thiſtle, Sage, Betony, Myrrh, and the like. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Leaves of Rue, Sage, Plantan, Polypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Vervain, common Wormwood, Mint, Mugwort, Baum, Betony, St. <hi>John</hi>'s-wort, Leſſer Centory, of each a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient quantity; beat them into a Pouder, to be taken from one to two Drams in hot Broth, or a draught of Wine, or in half a Dram of <hi>Venice</hi> Triacle and Syrup of Lemmons, for forty days together at leaſt.</p>
                        <p>The Waters of Germander, <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentil, Triacle, white Maiden-hair, and the like, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Vehicles for ſuch Pouders.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, ſeal'd Lemnian and Melitean Earths are good; alſo <hi>Venice</hi> Triacle, Mithridat, <hi>Electuarium de Ovo,</hi> &amp;c. but above all, <hi>Theriaca Diateſſaron</hi> with Opium. As,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Water of the Flowers of St. <hi>John</hi>'s-wort an Ounce and a half; <hi>Venice</hi> Triacle half an Ounce; Bezoar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic Tincture a Dram and a half; Eſſence of Crabs-eyes a Dram: mix them for one Doſe. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Venice</hi> Triacle one Dram; Salt of Wormwood half a Dram; let them be taken in a Draught of ſharp Wine.</p>
                        <pb n="555" facs="tcp:207638:278"/>
                        <p>The uſe of theſe and ſuch like Antidots muſt be perſiſted in for two or three Months; for oftentimes after it has lain hid for ſome Months, nay ſometimes years, the <hi>Hydropho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia</hi> will again ſhow it ſelf; ſo that tho the uſe of Sudori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fics may, yet that of Specifics ought not to be diſcontinu'd. As for example,</p>
                        <p>Take of prepar'd Crabs-eyes, burnt Hartſhorn prepar'd, and prepar'd Jaw-bone of a Pike, of each a Dram. Mix and make a Pouder.</p>
                        <p>The River-Crab alone is a Specific againſt the biting of a mad Dog: It muſt be gathered in the Dog-days, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin'd alive: A Dram or two of the Aſhes, with a Dram of Pouder of Gentian, may be given in a Cup of good Wine, the Patient being prepar'd for Sweating.</p>
                        <p>But the better way of exhibiting River-Crabs, is to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtil them (being well bruis'd) with an Alembic in a Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-bath; ſo you ſhall have the fam'd Water of Crabs: and what remains at bottom may be given inwardly from half a Dram to a whole one, in their own diſtill'd Water, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Pouder of Gentian-root or Pimpernel. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Venice</hi> Triacle a Dram; River-Crabs thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd, Roots of Pimpernel, of each half a Dram.</p>
                        <p>The Root of the wild Roſe-tree is commended by the Antients.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Staeckerus</hi> us'd to give a Dram of Pouder of Gentian, mix'd with as much <hi>Venice</hi> Triacle, every Morning for three days, injoining the Perſon to faſt five or ſix hours after, and make account to ſweat; having firſt ty'd on the Wound Garlic, Rue and Salt, bruis'd and mix'd in the form of a Cataplaſm: which Method he ſays never fail'd him.</p>
                        <p>Some Remedies are taken from the mad Creature it ſelf, ſuch as its Blood pulveriz'd, given to a Dram for three days: Its Hair, Heart, or Liver boil'd or pouder'd.</p>
                        <p>Some plunge the Patient into cold Water over head and ears ſuddenly, keeping him under Water a ſmall time.</p>
                        <p>Purging is ſparingly to be us'd, and that only when the <hi>Hydrophobia</hi> is but juſt a beginning; in this Caſe white and black Hellebor, as alſo Species of <hi>Hiera picra,</hi> are proper.</p>
                        <p>Strong Diuretics are not amiſs; among which Valerian and Cantharides are Specifics.</p>
                        <p>As to the Wound by which the Infection is receiv'd; ſo ſoon as poſſible the malignant Poiſon is to be drawn forth, leſt it diffuſe it ſelf through the blood. Let the Hair of the mad Creature, if it can be had, be laid on the Wound:
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:207638:279"/>or the place being ſcarify'd and cleans'd with the exacteſt care, apply this Cataplaſm.</p>
                        <p>Take one of the ſharpeſt Onions, five Cloves of Garlic, and half of its Root; <hi>Venice</hi> Triacle ſix Drams; with half an Ounce of Yeſt make a Cataplaſm.</p>
                        <p>Several other things may be added, ſuch as Hony, Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard-ſeed, Germander, Gentian, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Some apply the Liver or Fleſh of the Creature, as alſo live Pigeons; others uſe Scarification and Cupping-glaſſes: others waſh the ſcarify'd Wound with Wine, or its Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit camphoris'd, Brine, Salt Water, Decoction of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, or Gentian-root in Water or Wine; applying af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the following Plaiſter.</p>
                        <p>Take ſix Ounces of Wax, Oil of Olives and Goats Fat, of each three Ounces; melt them, and add of beſt Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe half an Ounce.</p>
                        <p>The Wound is to be kept open for ſome time, or even enlarg'd; and if it is clos'd up before the compleat Cure of the Diſeaſe, it muſt again be open'd.</p>
                        <p>But the moſt ſafe, and withal the moſt ſpeedy Remedy is burning with a hot Iron or an actual Cautery, which ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroys all the Poiſon, aboliſhing its ſeminal Craſis; and ſo leaves the Patient ſecure as to the fear of diſmal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents.</p>
                        <p>This were the proper place to treat of the <hi>Delirium Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicum</hi> occaſion'd by the biting of the <hi>Tarantula,</hi> and cur'd by Muſic; but ſeeing it is not to be found with us, we ſhall paſs it over.</p>
                        <p>As for <hi>Deliriums</hi> proceeding from poiſonous things, whether taken down by the Mouth, or drawn in with the Breath; the firſt is cur'd by a Vomit given at firſt; and the laſt, after univerſal things are premis'd, by Vinegar, Caſtor and Camphyr given together, or ſeparately with proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.</p>
                        <p>As for Love-fits; they are remov'd partly by rational Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, and partly by ſuch Medicines as have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd in Melancoly, and Melancolic Diſtempers, with this only difference, that the milder ſort will here prevail.</p>

                  <p>SOME part of the Chyle accompanying the Blood in the Arteries, is convey'd by the Spermatic Veſſels to the Stones, where 'tis in good meaſure prepar'd, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a particular Ferment for that purpoſe; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards finiſh'd in the <hi>Epididimes,</hi> which forward it to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Veſicles, to be there reſerv'd under the Character of the Genital Liquor, till the Act of Venery diſlodg it.

                  <p>It is enrich'd with a large ſtock of Spirits, eſpecially by the eagerneſs of the Venereal Encounter, and is thereby enabled to reach and impregnat the Womens ſeminal Eggs. It is likewiſe cover'd with a ſoft ſerous Vehicle prepar'd in the <hi>Proſtatae,</hi> that joins it in its Paſſage, and accompanies it thro the <hi>

                  <p>The manner of its engaging with the ſeminal Eggs in Women, and their Counterpart in the Act of Generation, is accounted for elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>When the Generation of this Male Genital Liquor is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd, it appears in its Deficiency, Redundancy, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation. The two laſt are referr'd to the Paragraph of Gonorrhaea's; the firſt is the Subject of the following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="chapter">
                     <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of the Defect or Inſufficiency of the Genital Liquor in Men.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE Cauſes relate either to the Matter it ſelf, or the Stones in which 'tis prepar'd. As touching the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, naturally 'tis the Chyle, or mucilaginous, fat, milky part of the Blood, as appears by its Conſiſtence, Color, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now whatever impairs this, muſt conſequently cauſe a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of Seed. Such are Hunger, the Diſorders of the digeſtive Faculty, exceſſive Evacuations, Watchings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Violent Paſſions of the Mind, immoderat Exerciſe, and ſuch like, rarify and ſharpen the Blood beyond its due pitch, and ſo exhauſt the Chyle or ſeminal Matter. Fat and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulent Perſons are liable to the like Inconvenience. The milky part of their Blood, which ſhould be diſpos'd of for ſeminal Uſe, is diverted and anticipated by its Converſion into Fat.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes relating to the Stones, proceed either from the defect of the Ferment, or the Indiſpoſition of the Stones themſelves. As for the former; queſtionleſs 'tis a ſpirituous oily volatil Subſtance, as appears by the notable Changes occaſion'd by it in the Maſs of the Blood at the time of its Commencement. Now whatever fixes the Animal Spirits, and ſtrips them of their volatil Capacity, muſt needs weaken the Ferment. Such are Spirit of Vitriol, Crude Nitre; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Cold, or expoſing the Stones to be wet; Application of mercurial things to the Region of the Pubes; exceſſive or unſeaſonable Venery, or an indiſcreet abſtinence from it;
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:207638:280"/>Drunkenneſs; Crudities in the Stomac, or any Diſorder of the firſt Digeſtion; Dropſies, Cachexies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Deficiency of the Ferment be occaſion'd by any Cauſe reſpecting the Stones themſelves, it muſt proceed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Tumours in 'em, or from being gelded. 'Tis much doubted if there be any natural Eunuchs; for many whoſe Stones are not viſible, may have 'em hid within the Abdomen, and give ſufficient proof of their Manhood.</p>
                     <p>The Signs are eaſily diſtinguiſh'd: If the Ferment be faulty, the Perſon is dull and unactive; the venereal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petit flat; and the Seed when caſt forth is thin, watry, and void of heat. The Prognoſtics are more fatal to the <hi>Species</hi> than to individual Perſons. If the Perſon be old, or have over-acted in his Youth, the Cure is very difficult. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times this Deficiency produces not only Effeminacy and Unmanlineſs, but an univerſal Faintneſs and Conſumption, for want of the due Influence of the Ferment upon the Maſs of Blood.</p>
                     <p>In regulating the Cure, a peculiar regard muſt be had to the Stomac and digeſtive Faculty; for the flatneſs of this will cauſe a Deficiency of Seed. If the Diſeaſe proceed from a Defect in the Stones themſelves, the following Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs account for its Cure. As for the Faults of the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or thoſe reſpecting the matter of the Genital Liquor; the former muſt be amended by aromatic ſharp Incentives; ſuch as Ginger, Amber, Cubebs, Cloves, Cinnamom, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, Savin-berries, Borrace, Satyrium, Eryngo, Muſtard-ſeeds, Fennel-ſeeds, Rocket-ſeeds, Pepper, Cantharides, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Ants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The latter by temperat Fat, and chyle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Ingredients, as Milk, the milky Seeds, Emulſions, Yelks of Eggs, with Spaniſh Wine, Oyſters, Chocolate, Dates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But neither of 'em ought to be us'd ſeparatly; but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with one another. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of Milk three Ounces; Sugar three or four Drams; Pepper half a Dram: mix for a Draught.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Oil of Fiſtic-nuts one Spoonful; the Yelk of one Egg; Ambergriſe as much as will lie upon the point of a Knife, with the triple quantity of Sugar. Mix 'em before the Fire, and exhibit for one Draught.</p>

                        <p>THE Stagnation of the Blood cauſes Inflammations of the Stones or Cod. That may be occaſion'd by the ſuppreſſion of a Gonorrhaea, violent Ligatures, Contuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Blows, Compreſſion by riding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Signs are a pricking ſhooting Pain, notable heat and redneſs beſetting the affected Teſticle and neighbouring parts, accompany'd by a ſlow Feaver. The Pain is exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by touching, and reaches almoſt to the Loins.</p>
                        <p>If it be not quickly diſcuſs'd, it tends to a Gangrene or Impoſtume, eſpecially the Inflammation of the Cod.</p>
                        <p>The Cure conſiſts in diſcuſſing the ſwelling, and mitigat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pain. If that cannot be obtain'd, it muſt be ripen'd and open'd. For the former purpoſe, Bleeding and the common Evacuations, and ſuch gentle Diaphoretics as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Circulation of the Blood, are the proper internal Remedies.</p>
                        <p>Outwardly apply the following Cataplaſm. Take of the Meal of Beans three or four Ounces; Pouder of Cuminſeeds two Ounces: With Vinegar make a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſm. If the Vinegar be too ſharp, add of Lytharge of Ceruſe from one to three Ounces. (For Lead and its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions dulcify the ſharpneſs of Vinegar.) Apply this Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm warm to the part, for all ſorts of Inflammations.</p>
                        <p>Take of Quick-lime-Water a Pound, or a Pound and a half; Spirit of Wine camphoris'd half an Ounce, or an Ounce; Ceruſe or Sugar of Lead a Dram and a half. Make an Epithema to be applied hot: And if the pain be violent, add of Opium diſſolv'd in Vinegar one Scruple.</p>
                        <p>For venereal Inflammations let the Part be fomented with the Decoction of <hi>China</hi>-roots and Elder-flowers in Ale or Wine.</p>

                        <p>Rue, Agrimony, Vervain, Chamomile, the Herb <hi>Paris,</hi> Elder-flowers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are alſo proper Ingredients for Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſms or Decoctions. If the Pain be violent, add to them Leaves of Henbane, thus:</p>

                        <p>If the Tumour cannot be diſcuſs'd, emollient ſuppurating things are proper; as the Plaiſter call'd <hi>Filii Zachariae</hi> ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd with Balſam of Sulphur prepar'd with Oil of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentin. If the Pain be overbearing, let the Leaves of Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane be roſted under the Aſhes, bruis'd and applied with Lard in the form of a Cataplaſm.

                        <p>THE Cauſe is the Rupture of the Lymphatic Veſſels in the Stones, or whatever ſtops the reflux of the Lymph from thence.</p>
                        <p>The Signs are a ſenſe of ſomething floating in the Cod, the alteration of the form and bigneſs of the Stone, the lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid and unwrinkled appearance of the Cod before a Candle.

                        <p>The Cure is perform'd inwardly by Antihydropic Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines. Externally let the Balſam of Sulphur prepar'd with Oil of Turpentin, or <hi>Schroder</hi>'s Plaiſter <hi>ad Horniam,</hi> or the <hi>Ausburg</hi> Hydropic Plaiſter be applied. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take of the Plaiſter of Bay-berries, Goat's Dung, of each an Ounce and a half; Cumin-ſeeds, Flowers of Sulphur, of each two Drams. Mix with the Oil of Rue and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momile, and make a Plaiſter.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Flowers of Chamomile, of the Herb <hi>Paris,</hi> of each two handfuls; Meal of Beans, from half an Ounce to an Ounce; Goat's Dung three Ounces; Pouder of Cockle-ſhells two Ounces.

                        <p>If a <hi>Hydrocele</hi> be inveterat, all external Diſcuſſives are in vain, and only Surgery can afford relief. There are two ways by which it performs the Cure. 1. By pricking, or boring a hole in the Cod and outermoſt Coat of the Stone,
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:207638:283"/>under which the Lymph is wont to be lodg'd. 'Tis a ſafe Operation in a ſimple <hi>Hydrocele;</hi> but in hydropic Tumours for the moſt part it cauſes a Gangrene. 2. By cutting away the affected Stone; for ofttimes it relapſes after a pricking, or the neighbouring parts are in danger of a Gangreen, in which caſe Amputation is needful.</p>

Thoſe of the third are, exceſſive Venery (eſpecially in ones Youth) and manual Violence, which not only relaxats the ſeminal Veſicles, but deſtroys the Ferment in the Stones, as appears by the watry inelaborat Conſiſtence of the Seed.</p>
                        <p>If a genuin Running be inveterat, it degenerats into a Hectic, and is not eaſily cur'd; nor is it ſafe to ſtop it ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, leſt the Suppreſſion of the wonted Evacuation ſhould cauſe an Inflammation or Tumour in the Teſticles.</p>
                        <p>The general Indications of Cure, are to leſſen the vicious quantity, or qualify the ſharpneſs of the matter, or to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborat the Ferment and Texture of the parts.</p>
                        <p>For the firſt of theſe Purpoſes, acid thin Food, ſhort Commons, frequent Exerciſe and Watchings are proper. Spirit of Vitriol and Crude Nitre powerfully curb the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Teſticles: But the Juices of Citrons, Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granats and Lemons, are more temperat and univerſally applauded for ſtopping all manner of Runnings. The Juice of Lemons with Spirit of Turpentin, and Camphyr, is extoll'd by <hi>Faber.</hi> Some commend the ſolution of Coral with Juice of Citrons. Emulſions of Hempſeeds are of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign uſe in deſperat Runnings, but they enjoy a narcotic Virtue prejudicial to the Animal Spirits.</p>

                        <p>Take of Hempſeeds half an Ounce; Seeds of the Chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree two Drams. With the Water of Yarrow make an Emulſion. Add of prepar'd Amber and Bone of the Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-fiſh, of each a Dram. Sweeten and reſerve it for uſe.</p>

                        <p>Take of the Leaves of white Archangel four handfuls; Leaves of white Yarrow two handfuls; Seeds of the Chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree four or ſix Drams. Boil them in Mint or Rue-water, or in Wine, and ſweeten with Syrup of Water-Lillies.</p>
                        <p>Some recommend a Spoonful of the Juice of Ceterach to be taken now and then, as a ſingular Remedy for ſtopping a <hi>Gonorrhaea;</hi> as alſo two Drams of the following Pouder to be taken in Chalybeat Wine.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Leaves of Mint and Rue, Seeds of the Chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, and Pouder of Galls, of each equal quantities. Beat 'em into Pouder for the uſe above-mention'd.</p>
                        <p>Spirit of Turpentin and Sugar of Lead is a delicat Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. The Juice of Yarrow or of Mallows with ſweet Milk is alſo approv'd. Some apply outwardly the Juice of Lettuce with Camphyr to the Teſticles.</p>
                        <p>As touching the ſecond Indication, <hi>viz.</hi> qualifying the ſharpneſs of the ſeminal matter, the Tincture of Coral with Spirit of Woods, or of Saſſafras, is very uſeful.

                        <p>Take of the Conſerve of Red Roſes, Conſerve of Mint, of each an Ounce or an Ounce and a half; prepar'd Bone of the Cuttle-fiſh (which in this Caſe is a noted Specific) two Drams; Calcin'd Borace a Dram; Nutmegs half a Dram; Syrup of dry'd Roſes as much as ſufficeth to make an Electuary. Of which the Patient may take a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent quantity twice or thrice a day.

                        <p>The Turpentine of Cyprus reduc'd to Pills with prepar'd Amber, or Crocus of Steel, or Rhubarb, is very effectual. Of late the Balſam <hi>Capivi</hi> is mightily eſteem'd. Sugar of Lead, and the Antiphthiſical Tincture prepar'd with it is of noted efficacy.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Waters of Rue and Water-Lillies, of each half an Ounce; Juice of Lemons ſix Drams; Bole-Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic a Dram; Cuttle-bone, and Diaphoretic Antimony with Steel, of each two Scruples; Syrup of Citrons half an Ounce.

                        <p>As for the third Indication, <hi>viz.</hi> corroborating the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxated parts, and correcting the watrineſs of the ſeminal Liquor; Mint, Wormwood, Amber, Maſtic, Aſtringent Tincture of Steel, Tincture of Coral, Pouder of Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe (which if too frequently repeated, cauſes a ſuppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Urine) Sugar of Lead; Extract of Tormentil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roots; ſeal'd Earth, and Bole Armenic us'd with Vinegar; Tincture of the Sulphur of Vitriol, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are all proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients.</p>

                        <p>If in the Declination of this Flux, a thin, watry Humor continue to run, as it frequently happens; take of Gum Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bic, Tragacanth, prepar'd white Amber, prepar'd Mummy, Bole Armenic, of each a Scruple; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum</hi> half a Scruple. With a ſufficient Quantity of the Tincture of Catechu, make Pills for five Doſes.</p>
                        <p>The natural Baths that partake of Allum are proper in an inveterat Caſe.</p>
                        <p>Outwardly the parts may be fomented with the Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Rindes and Flowers of Pomegranats, Roſes, Comfrey-roots, Plantain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or let the Perinaeum be anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the following Mixture.</p>

                        <p>If the ferment of the Teſticles be deſicient, Milk, Rice, Eggs and aromatic Ingredients are proper. Ofttimes 'tis needful to purge both in the beginning and progreſs of the Diſeaſe; as thus,</p>

                        <p>I am now arriv'd at the ſpurious Flux of Seed, which is call'd ſuch when the matter voided is of a different nature from the Genital Juice, being diſcolour'd, ſharp, ſtinking, attended ſometimes by Pain and other Symptoms; but not occaſion'd by venereal Actions, or partaking of any vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Virulency. It correſponds to the Whites in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and is call'd by ſome <hi>Gonorrhoea Catarrhalis;</hi> but there are few Authors that have taken any notice of it.</p>
                        <p>The part affected is the <hi>Proſtratae,</hi> whoſe Office 'tis to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parat a Lymph for a Vehicle to the Seed. Now if they are relaxated or exulcerated, they ſeparat and void larger quantities, as in the like caſe the Glandules of the Eyes, or thoſe in the Throat, are wont to do.</p>
                        <p>The material Cauſe is the ſerous cachectic Diſpoſition of the Blood. The remote Cauſes are the Diſorders of the Stomac and digeſtive Faculty, or whatever equips the Blood with crude and watry Particles. The formal efficient Cauſe is the Relaxation of the <hi>Proſtratae,</hi> occaſion'd by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Venery, manual Violence, Riding, a Fall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Tho this Flux may ſerve to cleanſe the Blood, yet if it continue long, it degenerates into a Conſumption.</p>
                        <pb n="571" facs="tcp:207638:286"/>
                        <p>The Cure turns upon corroborating the Stomac, correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Crudity of the Blood, and cleanſing and fortifying theſe Glandules. The firſt of theſe Deſigns is compaſs'd by the uſe of Wormwood, Mint, Roſemary: The ſecond by the Decoctions of Woods with Tormentil, Eſſence of Saſſafras, volatil Salt of Amber, Turpentin, Maſtic, Gum Animi, Pouder of Frankincenſe taken in a potch'd Egg, drinking Spaw-waters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After which bathing in natural Baths, or artificial ones partaking of Allum, anſwers the third Indication. But this laſt is not to be attempted till the former are accounted for.</p>

                        <p>THIS was the ſecond Diſorder relating to the ejection of Seed.

<pb n="572" facs="tcp:207638:287"/>inſomuch that they cannot eject the Seed in due time, but it often ſlips out when the Yard is down, and the Turgeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the Parts gone.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THERE are two main Qualifications requiſit for performing the Office of a Husband; one is the due Erection and ſtiffneſs of the Yard; the other the regular Ejaculation of the Seed thro the Yard thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd. This was the Subject of the preceding Section: The former lies now before us. In order to ſet it in a clear light, we muſt diſtinguiſh the Turgeſcence and Diſtention of the Yard from a due Erection. The former proceeds from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of arterial Blood into the two nervous Bodies; but this Diſtention is continu'd and wrought into a State of Rigidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Erection by the Contraction of the two pairs of Muſcles ſeated at the Root of the Yard, which compreſs the
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:207638:287"/>Vein that runs along its Back, and ſo hinder the reflux of the Blood. When their Contraction ceaſes, the Blood that diſtended the Yard is diſcharg'd by this Vein, and leaves it in a drooping condition. So this Contraction of the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles is the Cauſe of Erection, and is in good meaſure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by the ſpirituous and provoking quality of the Seed in the Seminal Veſicles.</p>
                  <p>What is needful to be ſaid of the faults of Erection will fall under the Heads of its Deficiency, Exceſs or Depravation.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of Impotency, or the Defect of Erection of the Yard.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IT proceeds either from the Relaxation of the two Pairs of Muſcles and inactivity of the Spirits, or the flatneſs of the Seminal Liquor.</p>
                     <p>The Muſcles may be relaxated by a Palſy, Exceſſive Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a Fall or Blow upon the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> or Wound of the Head affecting the reſpective Nerves, mercurial Inunctions, external Cold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Spirits are faulty when they are univerſally weak and languid, as in old Age and Sickneſs; when they are diſorder'd by Paſſions of the Mind, ſuch as Baſhfulneſs and Fear (of which we have ſeveral Inſtances in new married Youngſters, that fancy themſelves bewitch'd) or diverted by dwelling upon other Objects, or baulk'd by hypochondriac Deſpondency.</p>
                     <p>The Genital Juice is faulty, when 'tis not duly prepar'd, or falls ſhort of its ſpirituous ſtimulating quality. This may be occaſion'd by old Age, defects in the Stones, or any Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of the Genital Parts; or by the continu'd uſe of Nitre or Camphyr.</p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe is manifeſt of it ſelf. All the uſe of Signs is to diſtinguiſh the Cauſes. If the Muſcles are paralytic, they are equally unmovable by all other Objects. If the Animal Spirits are deficient, an univerſal Feebleneſs ſeizes the whole Body. If hypocondriac Fancies, melancoly Thoughts or Paſſions of the Mind occaſion it, the Circumſtances of the Patient will diſcover 'em.</p>
                     <p>The Cure conſiſts in recovering the force and ſpiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Seed, and the regular Influx of the Spirits into the Muſcles. The internal Medicines anſwering theſe Indications are largely accounted for in the preceding Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In <hi>England</hi> Ambergriſe and <hi>Laudanum Opiatum</hi> are
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:207638:288"/>mightily extoll'd. Cantharides mix'd with aromatic Pouders are of noted efficacy.</p>
                     <p>Take of preſerv'd Roots of Satyrium and of Eryngo, Pine-nuts, of each two Ounces; candy'd Ginger, Nutmegs candy'd, of each an Ounce; Confection Alchermes half an Ounce; Rocket-ſeeds, Seeds of Creſſes, of each two Drams; white Pepper and Cloves, of each a Dram: With Syrup of Cinnamom make an Electuary.</p>
                     <p>Externally, Cephalic Baths, Fomentations, and rubbing the Parts before the Fire are proper. Let the Decoction of Cubebs in Wine be applied to the Teſticles and adjacent parts; or anoint the Perinaeum, Cod, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with <hi>Mynſicht</hi>'s Venereal Balſam mix'd with Oil of Ants.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Juice of Parſneps, Oil of Muſtard, of each two Drams; large Eggs of Emmets a Dram. Pound the Eggs, and ſet 'em in the Sun for a day or two; then mix all in the form of a Liniment; with which anoint the Nut of the Yard immediately before the Engagement. If the Erection continue after Enjoyment, waſh the Yard with warm Water.</p>
                     <p>The Spirit or Juice of Ants with Civet and Oil of Pepper or Caſtor, the Root of black Hellebor or of Pellitory of <hi>Spain,</hi> pouder'd and mix'd with the Fat of a Quail; And Wine in which Euphorbium and Pellitory of <hi>Spain</hi> have been boil'd; are all recommended for the ſame uſe.</p>

                     <p>THIS proceeds from the Contraction of the Muſcles at the Root of the Yard, hindring the Receſs of the Blood, which may be occaſion'd two ways; 1. When the Redundancy and Turgeſcence of the ſeminal Liquor irritats to a perpetual Erection, and deſire of Venery, which for the moſt part ceaſes after repeated Injoyment. 2.

                     <p>Take of the Waters of Vine-leaves and of Willow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves, of each an Ounce and a half; dulcify'd Spirit of Vitriol half a Dram. Mix and ſweeten with pearled Sugar.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Phlegm of Vitriol two Drams; Tincture of Dazies, Tincture of Roſe-flowers, of each half a Dram. Mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Or, make Cataplaſms of the ſame Ingredients with Vinegar. Let the Juice of Comfrey or of Lettuce, in which Nitre is diſſolv'd, be applied to the Stones, Loins, and all round the Genital Parts.</p>
                     <p>As touching the Second, <hi>viz.</hi> The Convulſion of the Muſcles cauſing a <hi>Priapiſmus,</hi> hindering the Reflux of the Blood, and imparting ſomewhat convulſive to the Yard; 'tis occaſion'd by the iritation of the Animal Spirits, whether by an internal or external Cauſe.

                     <p>As for the Method of Cure. Vomits are more proper than Purgatives, by reaſon that the latter frequently prove
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:207638:289"/>Incentives to Venery. After Vomiting let vitriolic and ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Acids be exhibited.

                     <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of the Depravation of the Erection of the Yard.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE Erection of the Yard is deprav'd when it ſtands awry, or departs from the natural Poſture. If the Bridle be ſhort, it ſtands crooked; but that is cur'd by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Bridle. If the Depravation proceed from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the Yard, 'tis cur'd by emollient Cataplaſms, ſuch as we preſcrib'd for the Inflammation of the Teſticles. Sometimes Erection is hindred by a Pain in the Yard, caus'd by frequent Venery; which is cur'd by thruſting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Paſſage Balſam of Peru, or the Leaves of Hemlock bruis'd. If the Pain be caus'd by a Stone in the Bladder, there is nothing better than to put the Yard into the Water of the Whites of Eggs with Woman's Milk and Camphyr.</p>
                     <p>The remaining Cauſes which diſturb the Erection of the Yard are thoſe relating to the Foreskin. They are of two ſorts; 1. When the Prepuce impriſons and ſtraitens the Nut, and cannot be drawn back. This is call'd <hi>Phimoſis.</hi> 2. When the Prepuce being drawn off, cannot be brought to cover the Nut again. This is call'd <hi>Paraphimoſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the firſt, if the Prepuce be naturally ſo ſtrait, it ought to be cut, but ſo as to avoid the Vein that runs along its ſide. If it proceed from the accidental Corrugation of the Prepuce, let the Cream of Quicklime be beaten up with freſh Butter, and applied to it. If it proceed from an Inflammation occaſion'd by the Embraces of a foul Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, foment the Prepuce and Nut with the following <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>

                     <p>Take of the Mucilages of Fleawort-ſeeds, of Quince-ſeeds; of Fenugrec-ſeeds, extracted with Plantain-water, of each an Ounce; the Yelk of one Egg; and three Ounces of Cows Milk. Mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Foment with the Water or Decoction or Quick-lime, warm; if you pleaſe you may add to it Sugar of Lead, or ſweet Mercury.</p>
                     <p>Take of Chamomile and Elder-flowers, of each a handful; Henbane-flowers, Aniſeeds, and Fennel-ſeeds, of each half a handful; Bay-berries half an Ounce. Cut, bruiſe, and boil them in Lime-water; and apply the hot ſtrain'd Liquor to the Part. Or make a Cataplaſm of the Meal of Beans with Lime-water for the ſame uſe.</p>
                     <p>As for a <hi>Paraphimoſis,</hi> 'tis occaſion'd for the moſt part by the firſt Venereal Encounter; and is ofttimes accompany'd by a ſwelling of the Prepuce. Upon which account ſoftning and diſcuſſing Ingredients ought to be joyn'd together.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Leaves of Marſhmallows, common Mallows, and Pellitory of the Wall, of each a handful; Marſhmallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roots and white Lilly-roots, of each an Ounce; Flowers of red Roſes, and Flowers of Chamomil, of each two little hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls. Boil them in Milk to the Conſiſtence of a Pultiſe, and apply to the part. Flowers of Chamomil, or of Elder, or of Henbane, may be boil'd in Milk or Lime-water, for a Fomentation. Or apply a Cataplaſm of white Bread, Yelks of Eggs, Oil of Roſes and Saffron. If the Pain be violent, Saffron ought always to be added.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THE moſt notable Alteration which happens to Women when they are ripe for Men's Embraces, is the monthly Evacuation of Blood by the ſecret Parts, beginning ordinarily in the fourteenth year of Age, and ending in the forty ninth; tho ſometimes it anticipates the former, and outlives the latter Date.</p>
                  <p>This Flux is call'd the Terms or Courſes, and returns duly once a Month, in ſome a few days ſooner, and in others ſo much later; only Child-bearing Women, and ſometimes ſuch as give ſuck are not liable to it.</p>
                  <p>It is caus'd by an extraordinary Fermentation and Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Maſs of Blood, occaſion'd by a peculiar fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative Power of the Glands of the Womb; whence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incapable to be contain'd within its ordinary bounds,
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:207638:290"/>it breaks forth at the Arteries of the <hi>Vagina,</hi> till by leſſening the quantity, the Fermentation ceaſes, in the ſpace of three or four days, till the next period.</p>
                  <p>This monthly Purgation is diſorder'd in the way of deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, increaſe, or depravation.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="chapter">
                     <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of the Deficiency of the Terms.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THis is commonly but improperly call'd a Suppreſſion of the Terms, and is occaſion'd either by a Default of the Blood, or of the Womb and Veſſels through which it flows. The Default of the Blood is its groſneſs, toughneſs and fix'd acidity, proceeding from the Diſorder of the Stomac, whereby it becomes unfit for a due fermentative Expanſion.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the Veſſels of the <hi>Vagina</hi> are obſtructed by a viſcid Phlegm; and ſometimes the ſides of the <hi>Vagina</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exulcerated, or otherwiſe hurt, grow together, in which caſes the wonted Flux is deficient.</p>
                     <p>The remoter Cauſes, are Cold, whereby the Blood is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated, Food of difficult Digeſtion, uſe of Acids; and finally, ſuch Affections of the Mind as naturally cool and thicken the Blood, ſuch as ſudden Frights, Sadneſs, Grief, and the like.</p>
                     <p>If this Diſeaſe is from the Blood, the ſtretching Pains of the Loins, beating of the Arteries of the Loins, and of theſe about the <hi>Os ſacrum,</hi> the ordinary Forerunners of this Flux, are not found; the Urine is crude, the Belly Coſtive, hypochondiac Symptoms prevail, and in time no ſtated pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riodical Alteration of Body is to be perceiv'd.</p>
                     <p>But if from the Womb, and its obſtructed Veſſels, the Symptoms abſent in the former caſe are preſent here, and that in a higher degree; with wearineſs of the Joints, prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pains of the Loins, Blood iſſuing from other parts of the Body, and that at ſuch times as the Courſes uſed to flow.</p>
                     <p>But the greateſt Difficulty is to diſtinguiſh this preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural State, from the natural Suppreſſion of the Terms by impregnation, which are accompanied with almoſt the ſame Symptoms.</p>
                     <p>However, we may conclude, that the Suppreſſion is preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, if the Patient grows ſtill worſe and worſe with an univerſal Paleneſs covering the whole Body, and decay of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite continuing beyond the third Month; if there are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:207638:291"/>Pains of the head, unuſual beatings of the Arteries, eſpecially in the Loins, frequent Viciſſitudes of heat and cold all over the Body, difficulty of breathing, eſpecially on every ſlight Motion of the Body, a frequent unequal obſcure Pulſe; and finally if the Urine is either thinner, Paler, or higher colour'd than ordinary.</p>
                     <p>If this Suppreſſion happens in the very time of the Flux, the Cure is eaſy, if timely and ſpeedy; but if the Suppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be of an earlier date, it is more ſlowly and difficultly cured, and oftentimes brings on divers other Diſeaſes, ſuch as Cachexies, Dropſies, various Ulcers of the Parts, Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, Diſorders of the Stomac, Melancoly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and at length Death it ſelf. Black Urine in this Diſeaſe is a good ſign.</p>
                     <p>In the cure of this Diſtemper we muſt endeavour, 1. To rectify the Chylification of the Ventricle, by Vomits and aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic volatil Medicines. 2. To amend the Crudity of the Blood by Chaly beat Medicines, and volatil oily Aromatics. 3. To remove that viſcidity of the Humours which obſtructs the Veſſels of the Womb, with Gums, and in particular, Gum Ammoniac, as alſo Mercurials, and chiefly <hi>Mercurius Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis;</hi> and above all, ſuch Specifics as are known to excite the monthly Fermentation of the Blood.</p>
                     <p>But to be more particular; 1. Specifics are never to be given, when the Diſtemper is confirm'd, before the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Evacuations.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Before we provoke the Courſes, we ought to conſider whether it be expedient; for in ſuch as are emaciated, new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recovered from ſickneſs, or who have never had them, it is not to be attempted.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. At ſuch time only the Terms are to be mov'd, as otherwiſe naturally they would have flowed of their own accord.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Of univerſal Remedies, the chief are ſuch as evacuate, whether upward or downward, and next opening a Vein. Vomits, whether prepar'd from Antimony or Aſarabecca given in the beginning of the Cure, yea ſometimes repeated, are of excellent Virtue; but Digeſtives muſt be premis'd. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Mynſicht</hi>'s <hi>Arcanum Duplicatum</hi> half a Dram, Chachectic Crocus of Steel two Scruples, with half a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Salt of Tartar. Mix 'em, and make a Pouder to be divided into two equal parts.</p>
                     <pb n="581" facs="tcp:207638:291"/>
                     <p>In the next place ſtrong Purgatives may be given, ſuch as Coloquintida and black Hellebor, of which, together with Alteratives, divers Compoſitions may be made up. As,</p>
                     <p>Take Gum Ammoniac diſſolv'd in Vinegar and thicken'd, Extract of back Hellebor, of each fifteen Grains; of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor and Extract of Saffron, of each three Grains; Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Alhandal two or three Grains. Make Pills with Oil of Turpentine or Amber. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Maſs of Pills of Hiera with Agaric, and <hi>Mercurius dulcis</hi> rightly prepar'd, of each fifteen Grains; of the Extract of Troches Alhandal two or three Grains; and make Pills with Eſſence of Caſtor.</p>
                     <p>Of theſe, and ſuch like, let the Patient take a Doſe every four or five days; and in the Intervals, let Bags of Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Aromatics be infus'd in Wine. As,</p>
                     <p>Take Roots of Angelica and Lovage, or Spignel, of each an Ounce; of Galangal half an Ounce; Leaves of Roſema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Fever-few, Savin, of each a handful; Bay-berries or freſh Juniper-berries an Ounce and a half; Cinnamom three Drams; Mace a Dram; Saffron as much; Salt of Tartar three Drams: cut, bruiſe, and tie them in a Bag to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd in Wine, of which take a draught in the Morning faſting, and two hours before Supper. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take Leaves of Mugwort, Pennyroyal and Roſemary, of each a handful; Roots of Angelica ſix Drams; Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon two Drams; Saffron a Dram: Cut, bruiſe and tye them in a Bag to be infus'd in two Meaſures of Rheniſh Wine, wherein red hot Steel has been ſeveral times quench'd.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Body being thus prepared, Bleeding will be very, expedient, unleſs the Patient have never yet had her Courſes, in which Caſe Bathings will ſuffice. If the Terms do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready flow but ſparingly, you may open the Saphaena in the Leg; as alſo if there is reaſon to fear they will not come at their wonted time; but if the Flux is at hand, and you deſire to facilitate it, then you may open a Vein in the Arm. Theſe Univerſals being premis'd, we muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to correct the complexion of the Blood; to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Steel and Chalybeat Medicines are of great force, ſuch as all cachectic Pouders, Earths, Infuſions and Extracts prepar'd from Steel, yea crude Filings of Steel, if the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach be ſtrong. Or,</p>
                     <pb n="582" facs="tcp:207638:292"/>
                     <p>Take Filings of Steel two Ounces; with one Ounce of Cinnamom, infuſe them in Wine, whereof take a good draught Morning and Evening before Meals.</p>
                     <p>Spaw-waters drunk, are very profitable.</p>
                     <p>Together with theſe you muſt uſe the volatil bitter Aromatics, eſpecially ſuch as are alſo ſpecific Movers of the Terms, as well internal as external, ſuch as Roſemary, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamint, Chervil, Lovage, Fever-few, Leſſer Centory, Hore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound, Savine, Wall-flowers, Flowers of Marygold, and Lavender Seeds abounding with a volatil Salt, or of a ſharp Aromatic Taſte; as thoſe of Rocket, Creſſes, Fennel, Aniſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Juniper and Bay-beries, Roots of Angelica, Fennel, Sea-holly, Briony, Madder, round-rooted Birthwort, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, Elecampane, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Alſo Mugwort, Baum, Gentian, Cinnamom, <hi>Caſſia Lignea,</hi> Galangal, Nutmegs, Cardamoms, Myrrh, and its Eſſence, <hi>Elixir Proprietatis,</hi> compound Tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Tartar, all Preparations of Myrrh, Gums, Coloquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida, Caſtor, Saffron, Milt of an Ox, Borace, alcalin Salts, rather volatil than fix'd: Alſo <hi>Mynſicht</hi>'s <hi>Arcanum Dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p>Take four Ounces of Nutmegs, and mix 'em well with twelve Ounces of fine Sugar, and take the bigneſs of a Walnut Morning and Evening. Or,</p>

                     <p>Take <hi>Zwelfer</hi>'s Tincture of Vitriol of Steel, or its Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Spirit of Wine, two Drams; Eſſence of Caſtor and Saffron, of each a Dram. Doſe, from forty to ſixty Drops twice or thrice a day in ſome hot Liquor: But withal, let the Patient moderatly exerciſe her ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Take Solution of Steel with Juice of Apples, compound Eſſence of an Ox's Milt, and that of Savine, of each two Drams. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take Eſſence of Caſtor two Drams; Quinteſſence of Roſemary, Spirit of Sal Armoniac with Amber, of each one Dram. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take Borace a Dram, Myrrh half a Dram; Saffron fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Grains. Make a Pouder for three Doſes. Or,</p>

                     <p>If the Suppreſſion of the Terms be from the default of the Womb, the obſtructed Veſſels are to be opened by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil penetrating Medicines mix'd with Sudorifics. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times manual Operation is requir'd.</p>
                     <p>If by a ſudden Cold, or other ſuch Cauſe, the flowing Courſes are ſtopp'd, let Blood at the Saphaena; and then let volatil oily Aromatics be given, which with a ſoft breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sweat will reſtore the natural Motion of the Blood; ſuch are Spirit of Sal Armoniac, and the volatil oily Salts. <hi>Sperma Ceti</hi> may be given to a Dram with Caſtor, in hot Ale; alſo ſome fix'd Salt, as that of Wormwood or Savine. If a grievous Pain moleſt the Womb, the Decoction of Chamomile, with the other foremention'd Ingredients, may be given inwardly; and what remains after ſtraining, may be apply'd to the Groin in form of a Cataplaſm.</p>
                     <p>But if from a ſudden Fear, Anger or ſuch like, the Flux is reſtrain'd; firſt open a Vein in the Foot, then give the Spirit of Sal Armoniac twice or thrice a day. Or,</p>

                     <p>To theſe internal Remedies, externals may be added, ſuch as Fomentations, Baths, Tumigations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They are us'd after opening a Vein in the Arm, at what time the Courſes are expected. They are prepared of common emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lient, or proper Aromatic Ingredients, ſuch as Savine, Fever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>few, Mugwort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As,</p>

                     <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of the immoderat Flux of the Terms.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IF the Courſes flow oftner, or in greater quantities than they ought naturally to do, 'tis call'd an immoderat Flux of the Terms.</p>
                     <p>In thoſe who labour of this Diſtemper, we may obſerve three things; 1. The ſtrength of the Stomach is impaired with dejection of Appetite. 2. They feel for the moſt part a ſtretching and tearing pain in the Back about the Loyns. 3. Thoſe who are ſcorbutic, abounding with a volatil Acid, are for the moſt part ſubject to it.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes reſpect either the Womb or Blood. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the former loſes its due firmneſs or tone, and dos not ſufficiently ſtrengthen and extend its Veſſels; ſometimes the Orifices of theſe Veſſels are over-dilated or broke open by force; as by over-ſtraining ones ſelf in taking up great Weights, hard Labour, Sneezing, Vomiting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But moſt frequently the Cauſe is in the Blood, either when it is too wateriſh; or when its Serum dos too much abound with a ſaltiſh Acidity, or Acrimony; or finally, when it is too much moved and heated by venereal Rage, Exerciſe, Joy, Anger, uſe of ſtrong Liquors, Aromatics, or too hot a Seaſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the evacuated Blood is thin, of a florid and brisk Colour, or if, when receiv'd on a Linen Cloth, it diſcovers a pale Circle, the Seroſity of the Blood is the Cauſe; but if the Patient perceives a gnawing, biting, itching Pain, twitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were the Genitals, with a deſire of Evacuation; then the Acrimony of the Serum offends: But if the void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Blood eaſily clots, is of the natural Colour, being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what obſcure; and if withal, the Cheeks are ruddy, Veins ſwol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, the Pulſe great, quick and frequent, then the fault lies in the over-heating, or fermentative irritation of the Blood.</p>
                     <pb n="585" facs="tcp:207638:293"/>
                     <p>This Evil is dangerous if of long continuance; inferring Weakneſs, Indigeſtion, Cachexy, ſwelling of the Feet, Dropſy, the Whites: and if the Patient is in years, it is for the moſt part incurable.</p>
                     <p>In the Cure we muſt indeavour three things; 1. Either to diminiſh the Blood by Faſting, Labour, or Blood-letting, or to alter it with Wormwood, Rhubarb, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or allay its Fervour and Fermentation, by Plantain, Purſlain, and mild Acids. 2. To check its Fluidity with things that thicken and allay its ſharp Seroſity with Chalybeat and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbent Medicines. 3. To ſtrengthen the Womb and its Veſſels, with Aſtringent and chiefly Martial Remedies.</p>
                     <p>Now with regard to theſe Indications, we muſt obſerve, 1. That a Flux of any conſiderable ſtanding muſt not be ſtop'd of a ſudden.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Diet muſt be well order'd, the Patient muſt be kept warm, with reſt of Body and Mind; her Drink muſt be warm, and ſhe ought to abſtain from Wine.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Mild Purgatives, and ſuch as leave ſome aſtriction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, may be uſed before the Flux, when a ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Seroſity abounds; as a Dram of Rhubarb mix'd with Conſerve of Roſes, or Syrup of Quinces; alſo Myrobalans. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take Pouder of choice Rhubarb a Dram; Marmalad of Quinces half an Ounce; Plantain-water an Ounce; Mix for a draught.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Bleeding increaſes the Diſorder, and ought not to be us'd: but inſtead of it, if the Blood is wateriſh, you may have recourſe to Sudorifics and Diuretics.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Opiats are of ſingular uſe in preventing and curing the Paroxiſm: but ſpecial regard muſt be had to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's Strength.</p>
                     <p>Remedies therefore in this Diſeaſe are either abſorbent, or allaying, in regard of the Blood, or aſtringent with reſpect to the Womb. The Oil and Spirit of Vitriol, given in Plantane-water, do's notably allay the ardour of the Blood; alſo prepar'd Nitre, <hi>Lapis prunellae,</hi> and mild acid Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents.</p>
                     <p>As for Aſtringents which thicken the Blood, and correct its fluidity: Theſe are Plantane, Purſlain, Shepherds Purſe, Nettles, white flower'd Yarrow, and chiefly their Juices; the Moſs of the wild Plum-tree, and that of the Oak, (gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a Dram twice or thrice in a potch'd Egg) Looſtrife with a purple Flower, the greater Comfrey and its Root,
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:207638:294"/>the Root of Biſtort, Nutmegs, Rinds of bitter Oranges, and their Decoction; the Bark of the Root of the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry-tree, Rinds of Pomegranates, and their Flowers; Poppv and Henbane-ſeeds, Pears, Services, Quinces, Medlars, Maſtic, and Wood of the Maſtic-tree; Miſletoe of the Oak, Steel and Chalybeat Remedies, Coral and its Preparations, Allum, Bole-Armenic, ſeal'd Earth, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Dragons Blood, the Dung of an Aſs, Gooſe, or Dog, the Yelk of an Egg, burnt Hartſhorn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of theſe, and ſuch like, many forms may be preſcrib'd. As,</p>
                     <p>Take red Coral prepar'd, yellow Amber, Bole-Armenic, Dragons Blood, of each two Drams; Plantain-ſeed, calcin'd Borace, of each a Dram; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum</hi> ſix Grains; <hi>Hartman</hi>'s Extract of Saffron a Scruple. Make a Pouder, which is of excellent uſe when the Diſeaſe proceeds from watry Blood.</p>
                     <p>Take Conſerve of Roſes vitriolated an Ounce; burnt Hartſhorn prepar'd, Blood-ſtone prepar'd, of each a Dram; Allum prepar'd with Sugar, twelve Grains; <hi>Laudanum Opiatum</hi> two Grains. Make an Electuary with the Syrup of acid Pomgranates, which is excellent in all bleedings of the Womb. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take Water of Frogs Spawn, and of Oak-leaves, of each ſix Drams; prepar'd Bloodſtone two Scruples; Moſes of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Scull a Scruple; Syrup of Myrtles three Drams. But it is in vain to multiply Preſcriptions, which any one may vary at his Pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>Externals may likewiſe be us'd. Some hang a Jaſper about the Neck: Some a Toad kill'd and dry'd: A Peſſary may be made of Aſſes and Hogs Dung with Juice of Plantane, and the Mucilage of Quince-ſeed. Injections for the Womb may be made of the Decoctions of ſimple Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, or their Juices, with addition of Allum.</p>
                     <p>If a grievous Pain and ſenſe of burning moleſt the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina, Henbane and Poppy-ſeeds may be added to Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents.</p>
                     <p>Some order a Woman to put on a Shift that has been for eight days worn by a Man, and add, that by ſo doing, ſhe runs the riſque of never having her Terms again.</p>
                     <p>Some commend Cataplaſms. As,</p>
                     <p>Take Carpenters Ruddle, Bloodſtone, and dulcify'd Earth of Vitriol, with red Bole, of each equal parts: Mix them into a Cataplaſm with Whites of Eggs and Vinegar,
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:207638:294"/>to be apply'd to the Belly, and particularly the Region of the Groin.</p>
                     <p>Natural hot Baths are excellent, if the Evil is inveterat.</p>
                     <p>Some alſo have found much good by fomenting the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Groin with a Spunge dip'd in the Decoction of Allum, either alone or with the addition of Knotgraſs, Roots of Biſtort, and the like.</p>

                     <p>WE ſhall caſt into this Head ſeveral Accidents and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults of this Flux, of which we treat in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Articles.</p>

                        <head>ART. I. <hi>Of the difficulty of the Terms.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>TO Women of an impure and Cacochymic Body, it often happens that a day or two before their Courſes are upon them, and ſometimes when they begin to flow, they are afflicted with Headaches, pricking and grievous Pains of the Stomac, beating and ſhooting Pains of the Loins, reaching ſometimes to the Groin; alſo Pains in the Belly, Palpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Heart, difficulty of Breathing; which Symptoms either ceaſe, or at leaſt diminiſh, when the Terms come; till theſe being over, thoſe alſo vaniſh.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Pains proceed from the Veſſels of the outer Neck of the Womb, which either being too ſmall, or ſtop'd up by the foregoing Flux, hinder the diſcharge of the fermenting Blood. Moreover, in thoſe of an ill habit of Body, Wind coming from the vitiated Bile, and pancreatic Juice, and paſſing from the Guts to the Meſentery, occaſions Spaſms and Contractions of the Nerves and Membranes, whence inſue the racking pains reſembling thoſe of the Cholic.</p>
                        <p>This Diſtemper, if not timely prevented, ends in a total Suppreſſion of the Terms; ſometimes diſmal hyſteric, and other bad Symptoms enſue.</p>
                        <p>In order to adjuſt the Cure, we muſt endeavour to rectify the vitiated Craſis of the Blood by Chalybeat and aromatic volatil Remedies, with the addition of gentle Laxatives.</p>
                        <pb n="588" facs="tcp:207638:295"/>
                        <p>In the Paroxyſm the Fermentation of the Blood ſhould be promoted by volatil Aromatics, the Efferveſcence of the Bile and pancreatic Juice ſhould be reſtrain'd by Chalybeat Medicines, and fix'd Acids.</p>
                        <p>In the Paroxyſm let gentle looſening Clyſters with Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine be injected; then exhibit the compound Eſſence of an Ox's Milt, either alone or with the liquid Eſſence of Steel; to which may be added, Eſſence of Saffron: alſo <hi>Elixir proprietatis,</hi> compound Tincture of Tartar, diſtill'd Oil of Aniſeed, or that of Amber. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take Penyroyal-water two Ounces; Water of Mug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort half an Ounce; Eſſence of Caſtor a Dram and a half; Spirit of Sal Armoniac half a Dram; diſtill'd Oil of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed three Drops; Syrup of Mugwort ſix Drams. Mix and make a Potion.</p>
                        <p>If eight days before the flowing of the Terms, an Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative and laxative Bag be given in Wine, the following hyſteric Pills will effect the Cure.</p>
                        <p>Take of Aloe three Drams; beſt Myrrh a Scruple; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts of <hi>Calamus Aromaticus,</hi> and <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> of each half a Scruple; of Saffron three Grains; of Roots of Gentian, round-rooted Birthwort and Dittany, of each five Grains. With Eſſence of Myrrh make Pills, to be given during the time of the Flux, from half a Dram to a whole one, for ſome days.</p>
                        <p>Sweet things ought to be avoided; but the following Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be taken by Spoonfuls, is of ſingular efficacy.</p>
                        <p>Take Water of Swallows with Caſtor, an Ounce and a half; Carminative-water an Ounce; Water of Pennyroyal half an Ounce; <hi>Spcrima Ceti</hi> a Dram; Crabs-eyes prepar'd a Scruple; Diaphoretic Antimony half a Scruple; volatil Salt of Amber eight Grains; Syrup of Cinnamom ſix Drams. Mix them.</p>
                        <p>If the Symptoms are grievous, we muſt have recourſe to <hi>Laudanum Opiatum;</hi> but always remember to mix it with ſuch Ingredients as provoke the Courſes.</p>
                        <p>If the Courſes are at hand, or begin to flow, a Vein may be open'd in the foot: if they are not look'd for, till after ſome days, Blood may be taken from the Arm.</p>
                        <p>Externally ſuch things as are preſcrib'd in the convulſive Cholic and hyſteric Paſſion, may be us'd: Alſo this Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                        <p>Take of Bay-leaves, Wormwood, of each two handfuls; Pennyroyal a handful; Flowers of Roman Chamomil and
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:207638:295"/>Flder, of each half a handful; Roots of Angelica and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage, of each two Ounces; Bay-berries an Ounce; Juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-berries half an Ounce; the four greater cold Seeds, of each two Drams; cut, bruiſe, and boil them with a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent quantity of Wine in a cloſe ſtopp'd Veſſel.</p>

                        <p>In curing this we muſt ſtrive to provoke the Courſes by all ſuch ſpecific Remedies as were order'd for the cure of their Suppreſſion; ſuch as half a Dram of <hi>Venetian</hi> Borace, with ſome drops of Eſſence of Saffron, given in Pennyroyal or Cinamon-water; alſo the Decoction of Savine, its Extract and Oil, Myrrh, Caſtor, volatil Salt of Amber, and ſuch like.</p>
                        <p>Blood may be drawn forth from the Foot; Cupping-glaſſes, with Scarification, may be applied to the Legs or Thighs; Fomentations of emollient Ingredients mix'd with ſuch as provoke the Terms, may be uſed if need be.</p>

                        <p>IF there's an Acrimony in the Blood with toughneſs and thickneſs, or if the Paſſages and Veſſels be narrow, there follows a dropping Flux of the Terms, which is either continual, or laſts every Period much longer than it ought, ending ſometimes in an exulceration of the Womb. If the Blood is groſs and thick, 'tis a ſtubborn Evil.</p>
                        <p>This is cured in like manner as the immoderat Flux.</p>

                        <p>SOmetimes the Courſes have not their due Colour, but are either watry-colour'd, whitiſh, livid, yellowiſh, black, or ting'd with divers ugly Colours; all which proceed from the ill Diſpoſition of the Blood and Chyle; to cure which after a Vomit, let Chalybeat Remedies, Aloe, Myrrh and Saffron, or compound Tincture of Tartar be given.</p>
                        <p>If the ſmell of the Menſtrual Blood offend by reaſon of the Putrefaction begun in the Womb-Veſſels, occaſion'd by its ſluggiſh Motion there: We muſt endeavour to reſtore its uſual ſwiftneſs. Myrrh, Saffron, <hi>Elixir Proprieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> compound Tincture of Tartar, Eſſence of Myrrh, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and its Eſſence, Balſam of Sulphur with Turpentine, Preparations of Aloe with <hi>Mercurius dulcis,</hi> do notably anſwer this Deſign.</p>
                        <p>If the Courſes come ſooner or later than ordinary, or obſerve no certain period, the default is in the Craſis of the Blood perverted, and the Genitals notably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled.</p>
                        <p>This Diſtemper is ever a Forerunner of a Cachexy, and ends either in a total ſuppreſſion, or a Dropſy.</p>
                        <p>Steel and Coral, and the noble Medicines prepar'd from them, accompliſh the Cure. But we muſt continue for ſome time in the uſe of them; joining ſuch things as either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote or retard the Flux, as occaſion ſhall require. Of Steel we have its Crocus's and Eſſences, artificial Spaws, artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Vitriol of Mars, <hi>Poterius</hi>'s Pills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From Coral we have its Sublimation with Sal Armoniac, and its Precipitat and Tincture: To all which we may a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>If the hypogaſtric Veſſels terminating in the outer Neck of the Womb, be naturally miſhapen, or miſplac'd, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd, by any ſupervening Obſtruction, and accordingly deny egreſs to the fermenting boiling Blood, it forces its Paſſage through other parts of the Body; ſuch as the Eyes, Mouth, Noſe, Breaſt, Navel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that either with or without order of time.</p>

                        <p>In curing this Dilſorder, regard being had to the ſound or cachectic Diſpoſition of Body, we muſt endeavour not to ſuppreſs the Flux, but bring it to the natural place.</p>
                        <p>Internals are of little uſe in the Paroxyſm, but out of it vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil Aromatics may be us'd to open the obſtructed Veſſels.</p>
                        <p>When the Flux is at hand, the Saphaena may be opened; alſo Cupping-glaſſies may be apply'd to the Groin, to the Calfs of the Legs, and inſides of the Thighs, ſometimes with and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times without Scarification, in order to turn the force of the Blood to the lower Parts: bathing of the Feet is alſo uſeful.</p>
                        <p>To open the Veſſels of the Womb, external Fomentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be apply'd to it; Fumigations of Coloquintida, Peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries with Hellebor, Aloe, and ſuch like, may be us'd: ſharp Clyſters are likewiſe not to be omitted: Or the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Pennyroyal, Camomil, Savine, with Coloquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida, may be injected into the Womb.</p>
                        <p>And thus much ſhall ſuffice for the Diſorders of the Terms.</p>

                     <p>The external Neck, or Vagina of the Womb, is a glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Membran, whoſe confus'd Glandules every where open into its Cavity, eſpecially two glandulous Prominences en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſing the Urinary Paſſage, which in time of Coition emit a whitiſh Liquor ſomewhat thick and glutinous.</p>
                     <p>If the matter of this genital Liquor is too copious, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, or ſharp, or if the foreſaid Orifices are ſomewhat looſe and flaccid, there enſues a Flux of that ſeminal Liquor, that diſappears and returns by intervals.</p>
                     <p>This Flux is ſometimes inoffenſive to the Patient, as being but little and ſeldom; but if it continue long, it muſt be cured by diminiſhing or tempering the ſeminal Liquor, or by ſtraitning the over-looſe parts.

                     <p>But if through default of the Blood and Chyle, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor ſeparated and collected by theſe Glandules becomes too ſharp, and either ſimply Salt, or tinctur'd with acidity; and if withal the Texture of this glandulous Membran is by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent runnings rendred looſe and flaccid; in this Caſe, I ſay, there follows a continual and much more copious Flux of a ſerous Liquor of various Colours, as yellow, black or green, and ſometimes of a noiſom ſmell.</p>
                     <p>This Flux is accompany'd with Cachexies, loſs of Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, ſwelling of the Feet, Belchings, Weakneſs, dulneſs of the venereal Appetite, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ofttimes occaſions Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs.</p>

                     <p>Two Scruples of the Pouder of <hi>Aſarum</hi>-root, given after the uſe of Digeſtives, is the choiceſt Vomit.

                     <p>IN the outer Neck of the Womb behind the Urinary Paſſage, there is a tranſverſe Membrane plac'd, which if the Lips of the Privity be drawn aſide, reſembles a Creſcent with a hole in the upper ſide; but when the Lips fall together, it has the appearance of three ſmall fleſhy Prominences like Myrtle-berries.</p>
                     <p>In the Integrity of this Membrane, together with the ſtraitneſs of the Vagina, does Virgin-Innocence conſiſt; and Virginity is ſaid to be loſt, when by the admiſſion of the human Yard the former is violently broken, or looſened and diſtended, and the latter widened; tho yet in the mean while it may be violated by other means.</p>
                     <p>Tho Virginity once loſt can never be properly reſtor'd, yet an artificial one, aping the true, may be obtain'd by ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Genitals, and retrieving their natural Tone: which is effected by Baths and Fomentations prepar'd of Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, ſuch as the Root of the greater Comfrey, Plantane, Ladies Mantle, Rob of Acacia, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to which Allum muſt ſtill be added.

                     </head>
                     <p>THE venereal Appetite or Luſt is nothing elſe but a tender ſenſe and tickling of the extended Clitoris, caus'd by the influence of ſeminal matter abounding in the two gland<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ous Prominences, and other Glandules of the Vagina.</p>
                     <p>This according to nature ought to be moderat; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is ſometimes deficient, and ſometimes it exceeds.</p>
                     <p>The languiſhing of the venereal Appetite is frequently occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd by the paucity of Genital Liquor, and its want of Spirits, proceeding ſometimes from another Diſeaſe, as the Scurvy, Whites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if this Appetite is altogether wanting, I am of opinion it is a default in the Structure or Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the parts, and admits of no cure.</p>
                     <p>As to the former, it is an Evil of little danger, ſave that it is ordinarily accompanied with barrenneſs.</p>
                     <p>The want of Genital Liquor may be ſupplied by the uſe of juicy Food and volatil Aromatics, ſuch as Musk, Civet, and Amber. But if it is only the effect of other Cauſes, 'tis cur'd by their removal.</p>
                     <p>Externally foment with the Infuſion of Ants, together with their Neſt; and anoint the Groin and Privities with the Oil of Ants, or with Aromatic Oils or Apoplectic Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam mix'd with Civet and Musk.</p>
                     <p>If the ſeminal humor contain'd in the glandulous Subſtance of the Vagina, either by too long retention, or otherwiſe, become ſharp, ſaltiſh, or ſomewhat acid, it excites ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the places through which it paſſes, ſuch an itching as diſturbs Sleep; it is ſometimes accompany'd with a deſire of Copulation, but oftner not.</p>
                     <p>In curing this, we muſt begin, if need be, with mild Lax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atives and Sudorifics, and, if needful, allay the Acrimony of the Humour, and finiſh what remains by external Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. The Internals are the Infuſions and Decoctions of Fumitory, Succory, Scabious, Baum, Penny-royal, Roots of Bryony, Black Hellebor, Polypody, <hi>&amp;c. Mercurius
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:207638:299"/>dulcis,</hi> and Troches Alhandal anſwer the purgative end, as the Eſſences of Elder, the Tincture of Coral, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Woods perform the alterative and diaphoretic Office.</p>
                     <p>Of Externals, the Preparations of Lead and Mercury are the beſt: ſuch as Vinegar wherein calcin'd Lead is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd. If the Evil proves ſtubborn, anoint the Lips of the Privities with an Ointment made up of one part of Oil of Tobacco, and two of the Ointment of Tutty; or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Bliſtering-plaiſters; or cut Iſſues in the Thighs.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the acid Humour retain'd corrodes the Lips of the Privities, and occaſions Wheals, Puſhes, and in fine Scabs, which are of a mild Character, but very itching; but there are others call'd <hi>Epinictides,</hi> yet different from thoſe little painful ones that ſpring from foul Embraces. However both the one and the other are catching, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultly cur'd.</p>
                     <p>For cure we muſt begin with ſuch Univerſals as are uſed againſt the Scab or Itch; eſpecially laxative Bags of the Root of Briony and Spurge: and if they are of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant kind, we muſt uſe Mercurial, and other Specifics for the Pox.</p>
                     <p>Externally you may apply Oil of Roſes mixt with Yelks of Eggs, and diſcolour'd by beating in a leaden Mortar. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Decoction of Quick-line one pound; Sugar of Lead a Dram. Inject one half, and foment with the other. If you ſuſpect Infection, inſtead of <hi>Saccharum Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi> take a Dram of <hi>Mercurius dulcis.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of Aloe and Myrrh, of each the bigneſs of a ſmall Peaſe; Verdigrice half as much; of white Wine, Roſe and Plantane-water, of each an Ounce: Mix for Injection and external Waſhing.</p>

                     <p>The Efferveſcence of the Blood, and by conſequence the Turgeſcence of the Seminal Liquor, muſt likewiſe be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd by frequent Bleeding and abſorbent Acids, ſuch as the Juice of Citrons, Lemons and Pomegranats; Nitre, Sugar of Lead, Coral, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and alſo by mild Sudorifics: and beſides, in order to put a ſtop to the Fury and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Motion of the Animal Spirits, 'tis convenient to add Poppy-ſeed, Opium and Camphyr.</p>

<pb n="598" facs="tcp:207638:300"/>manifeſt Cauſe; a ſlow, obſcure, and diſorderly Feaver; an unequal and inconſtant Pulſe; Vomitings in the day time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It only invades Virgins and Widows, or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men retir'd from Men; and is heedfully to be diſtinguiſh'd from the Cachexy or evil Diſpoſition of Body that's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to both Sexes.</p>
                     <p>It is difficult to be known: however, if no error in Diet, or the uſe of the ſix Nonnaturals; no Obſtruction of the Courſes, or other manifeſt Cauſe have preceded; or if the Patient of a forward brisk Maid is become ſad and anxious, or is a forlorn Widow, who formerly was a healthy Wife; we may in ſuch caſes conclude this to be the Diſeaſe, which the older it is has the worſt Symptoms following it.</p>
                     <p>In curing of it we muſt endeavour to correct the default of Genital Liquor, and remove the vitious Craſis of the Blood, and by proper Remedies cure the incident Symptoms.</p>
                     <p>For the former Intentions, Camphyr is a notable Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; it not only diminiſhes the quantity of ſeminal Liquor, and amends its virulency, but has a peculiar Virtue of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the Blood and Spirits.

<pb n="599" facs="tcp:207638:300"/>the ſtagnating Blood: for when there is too great a quantity of Blood, its due Circulation, and fermentative Turgeſcence being reſtrain'd, it becomes leſs ſpirituous and volatil, yea groſs and viſcid, and as it were, flat and uſeleſs. And as touching its quality, we ought to remember that tho all the Maſs of Blood is originally of the ſame condition and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet that which by the monthly Fermentation is meaſur'd out to be expell'd, undergoes a ſingular Change in the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the Womb, where it waits for Paſſage, and acquires a certain corroſive Acrimony, or aluminous Tincture.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THO this Diſeaſe is accounted peculiar to Women, and to proceed from the Womb, yet it is found by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be common alſo to Men, and to be of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with their hypocondriac and ſcorbutical Diſtempers: Its Symptoms are as follows.</p>
                     <p>The Paroxyſm is uſher'd in with noiſe and murmurings in the Belly, and ſometimes the apprehenſion: as it were of a Ball violently mov'd and toſs'd hither and thither, and riſing up gradually. It is always attended by a ſtretching or tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pain under the ſhort Ribs; a plentiful breaking of Wind upwards or downwards; frequent Yaunings and Stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; various and violent Pains in the Belly, either fix'd or floating; proſtration of Appetite and Coſtiveneſs; a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting ſometimes of a greeniſh or yellowiſh matter, of an acid or ſtrange Taſte; Palpitation of the Heart, with a ſmall, weak, and ſometimes intermitting Pulſe; Swooning, diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of Breathing, and danger of Suffocation; giddineſs of the Head, dimneſs of the Eyes; ſometimes frequent Laughter, various kinds of <hi>Deliriums,</hi> Convulſions, ſtrange Motions of the Joints and whole Body; ſometimes a total Ceſſation of all the Senſes internal and external: for the moſt part the beginning and increaſe of the Fit is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with coldneſs, ſucceeded in the declenſion with heat, ending in a large Sweat.</p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe proceeds from a vitious Efferveſcence in the Guts of a preternatural Acid, bred in the Stomach, <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>,</hi> or other Glandules, with the bilious Juice; whence the meſenteric Nerves being irritated, give riſe to the various
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:207638:301"/>Symptoms of the Abdomen. And the vitious Acid being carried into the Blood, occaſions alſo its Coagulation and Stagnation. To which we may join a diſorderly and diſturb'd Motion of the animal Spirits, eſpecially in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercoſtal Nerve, and thoſe of the <hi>Par vagum,</hi> which ſpread the Diſorder all over the Body.</p>
                     <p>The Paroxyſms of this Diſeaſe are reviv'd ſometimes by violent Paſſions of the Mind, as Anger, a Fright, Grief; ſometimes by ſtrong Smells, whether from ſweet ſmelling things, as Musk, Civet, Amber, Roſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it frequently happens, or from fetid things, according to the peculiar temperament of the Patient. To which we may add, as a confirming Circumſtance, the uſe of ſweet things, which eaſily turn acid.</p>
                     <p>When the hyſteric Woman lies deſtitute of Senſe and Motion, you may know if there is life, by uſing a Looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs, or Feathers, or blowing Snuſh up the Noſe.</p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe is ſeldom mortal in Maids, but diſappears for the moſt part in time of Child-bearing; or if it ſeize Women with Child 'tis dangerous; in old Women 'tis ſeldom cured.</p>
                     <p>In delivering the Cure of this Diſeaſe, we ſhall order what is to be done in the Fit, and what out of it. The Violence and Fury of Hyſteric Paroxyſms ſuffer us not to ſtand idle Spectators, but require a ſpeedy help, both with external and internal Remedies.</p>
                     <p>As for Externals, firſt we muſt apply to the Noſtrils ſuch things as yield a ſtrong and ſtinking Smell, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding ſtill the temperament of the Patient: Above all, I eſteem volatil penetrating Salts; as Spirit of Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac, Spirit of Hartſhorn, or any other urinous vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Spirit. In great Swoonings, Caſtor infus'd in ſtrong Wine, and the Smoak of things burnt may be uſeful, as that of Amber, Nutmegs, Feathers and Quills of Birds, chiefly of Partridges, Hairs and Horns of Beaſts, Lignum Aloes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the mean while, to allay the Contraction of the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines, apply to the Region of the Navel and Pit of the Stomac aromatic Oils, ſuch as that of Rue, Aniſe, Laurel, Caſtor, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, fetid Oil of Tartar, Guajacum, Spike, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or an Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made of Clary boil'd in Butter, or Camphyr diſſolv'd in Oil of Sweet Almonds. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take diſtill'd Oils of Amber, Spike, of each half a Dram; of Cumin half a Scruple; of Mace nine Drops. Mix and anoint the Back-bone, Region of the Navel, and Pit of the Stomac. Some apply beaten Garlic.</p>
                     <pb n="602" facs="tcp:207638:302"/>
                     <p>After anointing it will be fit to apply a Plaiſter of Galba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, to which ſome add Tacamahac, Caſtor, Pitch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A girdle ſtrongly ty'd about the ſhort Ribs is helpful; as alſo ſweet-ſmelling things apply'd to the Genitals, as a Peſſary anointed with Peruvian Balſam, or Oil of Nutmeg, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſome Civet is diſſolv'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It will likewiſe be proper to inject Clyſters of Carminative, Aromatic, and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating Ingredients, to which volatil Salts ſometimes may be added. As,</p>
                     <p>Take Chamomil with the Flowers, Leaves of Sage and Fever-few, of each a handful; Roots of Angelica and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage, of each ſix Drams; the four leſſer hot Seeds, Salt of Tartar, of each a Dram: boil them in a ſufficient quantity of common Water; to nine Ounces of the ſtrain'd Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, add Electuary of Bay-berries an Ounce; diſtill'd Oil of Amber, volatil Salt of Hartſhorn or Urine, of each a Scruple; the Yelk of one Egg: Mix them, and make a Clyſter.</p>
                     <p>To ſuch Decoctions you may alſo add Electuary of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Picra,</hi> Caſtor, diſtill'd Oils of Cumin, Caraways, Amber, Juniper-berries, Turpentine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or, inſtead of diſtill'd Oils, volatil Salts, from a Scruple to half a Dram; as that of Urine, Hartſhorn, Amber, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Clyſters of the Smoak of Tobacco are alſo approv'd.</p>
                     <p>If the Patient is plethorick, a Vein may be opened, but with due caution.</p>
                     <p>Internally in the time of the Fit, volatil and oily Salts are to be us'd, and in particular ſuch as readily cauſe ſweat, to which Opiats may be added: Bitter things therefore are in common uſe, ſuch as Set-wall, Southernwood, Wormwood, Lovage, Angelica, Gentian-root, Mint, Galangal, Penny-royal, Fever-few, Clary, its Decoction and Spirit, Roman and common Chamomil, Orange Peel, wild Carrot-ſeed, Juniper-berries, Garlic taken in Wine, its Electuary, Saffron, Roſemary, Myrrh, Elder and dwarf Elder-berries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which by virtue of an oily volatil Salt deſtroy the vitious Acid. To theſe we may add Caſtor, <hi>Aſſa foetida,</hi> the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil Salts themſelves; as Spirit of Sal Armoniac, Hartſhorn, volatil Salt of Amber (given from five Grains to twelve in Swallow-water with Caſtor) diſtill'd Oil of Amber; vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Salt of Soot, the Tincture of Tartar, Tincture of the Droſs of the <hi>Regulus</hi> of Antimony, Tincture of Caſtor prepar'd with Spirit of Wine or otherwiſe; all the ſeveral Preparations of the fore-mention'd Simples; <hi>Crollius</hi>'s Elixir
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:207638:302"/>for the Womb; Camphyr, the Spirit of human Secundine, chiefly that of the firſt Child; the Juice of Courſer's Dung, expreſs'd with Wine or Ale, or its Decoction: to all which we join Opium, Hyſteric <hi>Laudanum,</hi> Mithridate and Triacle; of which innumerable Preſcriptions might be made up. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Waters of Mint, Elder-flowers, and Fever-few, of each an Ounce; Eſſence of Caſtor three Drams; volatil Salt of Hartſhorn twelve Grains; that of Amber eight Grains; Hyſteric <hi>Laudanum</hi> nine Grains; Syrup of Orange Peel ſix Drams. Mix, and make a Potion. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take prepar'd Amber, prepar'd Pearls, or Crabs-eyes, Caſtor, of each a Scruple; diſtill'd Oils of Rue and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, of each five Drops. Mix, and make a Pouder.</p>
                     <p>'Tis to be noted that Preparations with Caſtor, and ſuch like fat volatil Salts, yielding a ſtrong ſmell, agree not with ſome Patients, for whom meagre Salts are more proper; as dulcify'd Salt of Nitre, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If ſweet Smells or Taſts be offenſive, we chooſe Medicines of contrary qualities.</p>
                     <p>After the Fit is over, if a Relapſe is feared, it may be prevented by the uſe of Medicines partaking of Steel. As,</p>
                     <p>Take Antiſcorbutic and Hyſſop-water, of each an Ounce and a half; Solution of Steel in Juice of Apples three Drams; Spirit of Scurvy Graſs a Dram and a half; fermented <hi>Laudanum</hi> two Grains; Syrup for the Scurvy three Drams. Mix, and make a Potion.</p>
                     <p>But if what is above preſcrib'd prove ineffectual, we may try a ſtrong Snuff, and if that has no effect, give a Vomit; yea Blood-letting has been found ſometimes to avail in deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat Caſes.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto we have preſcrib'd what is to be done during the Paroxyſm; when 'tis over, we firſt give Digeſtives, then Vomits, and afterwards Anti-hypocondriac and Antiſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butic Remedies: for Digeſtives, I refer you to the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condriac and ſcorbutic Diſeaſes. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take red Coral prepar'd, or Mother of Pearl, or Crabs-eyes prepar'd, half a Dram; <hi>Arcanum Duplicatum</hi> a Scruple; Salt of Wormwood half a Scruple. Mix for three Doſes.</p>
                     <p>For a Vomit, take <hi>Arcanum Duplicatum,</hi> or <hi>Tachenius</hi>'s vitriolated Tartar, nine Grains; <hi>Mynſicht</hi>'s Emetic Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar two or three Grains. Mix, and make a Pouder.</p>
                     <p>Next to theſe, Aromatics mix'd with mild Laxatives are to be us'd; and theſe almoſt the ſame as the internal Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifics preſcrib'd in the Fit. In ſhort, the Method of Cure is the ſame with that of hypocondriac and ſcorbutic Diſorders:
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:207638:303"/>So that alterative Bags of carminative Ingredients, ſuch as are friendly to the Nerves and Womb, infus'd in Wine, are of very good uſe. Or, whatever partakes of a volatil Alcali, or a volatil oily aromatic Salt more or leſs bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which deſtroys Acids, or has an anodine Quality; as the Roots of Angelica, Butter-burr, Set-wall, Lovage, Gentian, and the like; alſo Orange-peel, and all Aromatics, eſpecially Clary, and its Decoction; alſo Baum, Roſemary, Mug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, Sage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Carminative Seeds, or thoſe call'd hot; to which wild Laxatives, ſuch as black Hellebor and Brio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, may be added: As for example,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Leaves of Baum, Fever-few, Pennyroyal, of each a handful; Leaves of Senna, Roots of Gentian and black Hellebor, of each a Dram; prepar'd Spurge, and true aromatic Coſtus, of each three Drams; Set-wall, Salt of Tartar, of each half an Ounce: Cut, bruiſe, and tie them in a Bag to be infus'd in Wine.</p>
                     <p>Medicines of Steel are wonderfully helpful; as alſo ſuccinated Spirit of Salt Ammoniac given to thirty Drops at night, and mild Laxatives mix'd with Opiats.</p>
                     <p>Take Gum Ammoniac diſſolv'd in Vinegar half a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; Vitriol of <hi>Mars</hi> five Grains; Extract of Caſtor three or four Grains; Extract of Troches Alhandal a Grain; or of the Troches themſelves three Grains. Make Pills with the diſtill'd Oil of Amber.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>SOmetimes the outer Neck of the Womb, eſpecially its internal wrinkled Membrane, either by hard Labour, or the unskilful hand of a Midwife, or by an immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate red or white Flux, is ſo relaxated and extended, that it hangs out in form of a Ball, having a hole in the middle, two
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:207638:303"/>Fingers breadth without the Privity; and ſometimes ſome part of the internal Membrane is relaxated, and hangs out like a blind round Ball by a ſmall Neck. In this Caſe both the Antients and ſome of the Moderns fancy that the Womb falls down: Whereas that Symptom never happens but when an unskilful Midwife pulls it down by force, and ſo kills the Patient outright.</p>
                     <p>This Diſtemper is uſher'd in by a ſtretching Pain of the Parts to which the Womb is faſtened; ſometimes a Feaver and Convulſions ſupervene, and ſometimes the prominent Subſtance becomes the Seat of an Ulcer or Gangrene, and muſt be cut out by the hand of the Surgeon.</p>
                     <p>All that Art can do is, 1. To reſtore the Part fallen down to its natural Place. 2. To confirm it there either truly by Aſtringents, or palliatively by other means. 3. If that can't be compaſs'd, Amputation is the only relief.</p>
                     <p>The Patient being conveniently plac'd on her Back, let the part be gently put up with ones Fingers cover'd with a ſoft Cloth wet with the Decoction of mild diſcuſſive Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics; ſuch as Roſemary, Sage, Wormwood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> boil'd in equal parts of Wine and common Water, or Water from the Forge.</p>
                     <p>This done, Decoctions prepar'd of vulnerary Aſtringents are to be us'd internally; ſuch as thoſe of Rupture-wort, Mouſear, Knot-graſs, Comfrey-root, Cyprus-Nuts, Betony, Tormentil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to which Aniſe and Fennel-ſeeds, and the four greater hot-ſeeds may be added.</p>
                     <p>Externally alſo Aſtringents muſt be us'd; the place may be fumigated with their Smoak, or their Decoction injected, or the Privity fomented therewith, or a Peſſary of carded Wool may be dip'd in it and apply'd. Such Aſtringents are Galls, Oak-leaves, and thoſe of the Myrtle, Sloe-tree, Horſe-tail, Ladies-Mantle, Milfoil, Pomegranat-rind, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac, and the like, which may be boil'd in Forge-water, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Allum, if the Parts be not excoriated or exulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. The Moſs of the Oak-tree alſo, and Nettles and Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flower are commended.</p>
                     <p>For a Palliative Cure you may uſe Wax or Cork, white Wax, or the Maſs of a Plaiſter made of Wax, Colophon, Gum Elemi, and the like, ſhap'd into a round, oblong, or pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Form, according as there is occaſion, with a hole in the middle, and a thread faſten'd to 'em: their bigneſs muſt exactly anſwer that of the <hi>Vagina.</hi>

                     <p>But if it is only an Excreſcence, or one or two wrinkles of the <hi>Vagina,</hi> or if the <hi>Vagina</hi> it ſelf being fallen down is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the Air, or corrupted or ulcerated, it muſt be cut off by the Root, a Ligature being firſt made with a Thread; and then it muſt be cur'd as an Ulcer.</p>

                     <p>THIS is caus'd by Blood ſtagnating in the Pores of the Womb, which is occaſion'd either by too frequent Coition, or cold catch'd after Labour or the Terms, or by hard labour.</p>
                     <p>The Signs are a Swelling, Heat, ſtretching Pain of the Genitals, Groin, and Navel, which, if the Finger is put up into the Genitals, is exaſperated, extending to the Lips, Back-bone and Shoulders; the <hi>Vagina</hi> is red with ſwollen Veins, the Terms ſuppreſs'd, with a burning continual Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Thirſt, drineſs of the Tongue, Head-ach, Delirium and Convulſions.</p>
                     <p>It is dangerous enough, and is eaſily converted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Gangrene: Diſcuſſion is ſafer than Suppuration; ſometimes it degenerates into a Schirrus, and is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by a Dropſy.</p>
                     <p>The Patient muſt in the beginning be let Blood at the Arm, and, a Clyſter being given, next day at the Ancle: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward you may uſe temperat, emollient, and reſolving Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Decoction of Lettuce, Mallows, Violet-leaves, Flowers of Chamomil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> boil'd in Lime-water, mix'd with Lenitive Electuary, ſolutive Syrup of Roſes, and Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre.

                     <p>THE Cauſes are either internal, as retention of the Loches, ſuppurated Inflammations, Corruption of the <hi>Foetus</hi> or <hi>Mola,</hi> a virulent Clap, the Whites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or external, as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and exceſſive Venery, fretting of the <hi>Vagina,</hi> hard Labour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The naked Eye, or a Womb-glaſs diſcovers 'em; or if they lie deep in the Womb it ſelf, the troubleſom biting Pain of theſe Parts when tickl'd in Coition, or by ſharp Injections, reveals the Myſtery. They degenerate frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into Fiſtulas, or end in a Dropſy; and tho they be cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triz'd, infer Barrenneſs.</p>
                     <p>If they proceed from an external Cauſe, they muſt be cur'd by conſolidating Remedies; if from the ſharpneſs of Humours, they muſt be corrected and evacuated: but firſt of all the Pain muſt be mitigated.</p>

                  <p>COnception is nothing elſe but the Impregnation of one of the little Eggs contain'd in the female Teſtes, by a certain Air or Spirit exhal'd from the ſeminal Liquor of the Male received into the Womb. The Egg thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenc'd, falls off into one of the Womb-Trumpets, which at that time embrace the Teſtes, and thence paſſes unto the Womb. Being received there, it ſtraight begins to increaſe, and then one little point begins to diſtinguiſh it ſelf by its tremulous and leaping Motion, being ſurrounded with ſubtil red Threads, the Rudiments of the Blood-veſſels, round which
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:207638:305"/>ſome ſmall time after is to be ſeen ſomething more groſs and white, like a little Cloud diſtinguiſh'd into two parts; whoſe greater part conſiſting of four little Bags, repreſents a rude Draught of the Brain, <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> and two Eyes; and the leſſer part being ſtrech'd out below like a Ship's Keel, is the Rudiment of the Back-bone, from which the Limbs gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually extend themſelves, while the Bowels ſucceſſively ſhoot out from the Blood Veſſels, till the perfect <hi>Foetus</hi> is form'd.</p>
                  <p>The matter of which it is form'd is partly a clear Liquor reſembling the white of an Egg, convey'd thither by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and ſqueez'd through the glandulous Subſtance of the Womb into its Cavity; and partly Blood elaborat from the foreſaid Chyle or nutritious Juice; ſo that the Parts are rightly diſtinguiſh'd into ſanguine and ſpermatic.</p>
                  <p>There are ſcarce any infallible Signs of Conception; however ordinarily if a Woman hath conceived, the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Orifice of the Womb is cloſe ſhut up, the Terms are ſtopp'd; In the firſt days after Coition, a certain ſhiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or wandring Senſe of Cold ſpreads it ſelf over the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or its extreme parts; the Appetite is impair'd; ſhe vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits every Morning, and is troubled with longings, and loathing ſuch Meats as formerly were grateful. If the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is cacochymical, and ſcorbutic, ſhe is troubled with hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteric Affections, tho unacquainted with 'em before; a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Swelling invades the Belly, and points upwards. In the third, fourth, or fifth Month the Child is felt to move in the Belly; firſt more obſcurely, and afterwards more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly: finally, the firſt Months oftentimes diſcover a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyneſs and giddineſs of the Head, and ſometimes the Tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach; from which Signs concurring we may conclude the Woman is with Child.</p>
                  <p>With reference to. Conceptions, we ſhall treat of falſe Conceptions, Barrenneſs, and vitious Conceptions.</p>
                  <p>Conception is counterfeited by an Inflation or Swelling of the Belly, cauſed by external Air received unto the Womb after Child-bearing, or Abortion, or Bathing, or in the time of, or after the Menſtrual Flux, attended ſometimes with cruel pains girding the whole Belly.</p>
                  <p>This is diſtinguiſhed from a true Conception by theſe Symptoms. 1. The Belly is not always equally diſtended, 2. There is no motion, or at leaſt none but what may eaſily be diſtinguiſh'd from that of a Child. 3. The Swelling is greater, and leſs weighty, not preſſing ſo much upon the Pubes.</p>
                  <pb n="609" facs="tcp:207638:305"/>
                  <p>This Diſtemper is ſeldom dangerous, tho ſometimes when the Flux of the Terms or Lochia is ſtopt, 'tis attended by grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Pains in the Womb. In which caſe let the Vein <hi>Saphaena</hi> be opened; let the Digeſtion of the Stomach be promoted, and conſequently Wind prevented, by ſtomachic and Carmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native Medicines.</p>
                  <p>Let the Decoction of Saſſafras, with Aniſe and Fennel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeds, be us'd for a Diet-drink; and the Eſſence of Zedoary be taken every night going to Bed. Caſtor, Chamomil-flowers, Roſemary, Fever-few, Pennyroal, Sage, Flowers of Marigold and Groundſel, Roots of Elecampane, Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doary and Gentian, the four greater Hot-ſeeds, Galangal, Ginger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> their Decoctions, Eſſences, or diſtill'd Oils are of good uſe both inwardly and outwardly: to which we may add, the Species of Hiera, or the Maſs of Pills of Hiera, with Agaric, or the Extract of Elaterium.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes 'tis neceſſary to open the internal Orifice of the Womb to give vent to the Wind, by fomenting with the above-mention'd Decoctions; or applying to the Belly and Pubes Bags of Millet-ſeed, dry'd Salt, Chamomil Flowers, and Carminative-ſeeds boil'd in Wine and Water; or anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Oil of Chamomil, Oil of Bays and Caſtor; or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying a Cataplaſm of Goats-Dung and Carminative-ſeeds boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Wine, or a Plaiſter of Tacamahac with Balſam of Peru.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes a falſe Conception is feign'd by a Dropſy or Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of clear or yellowiſh Water in the Womb. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times this Dropſy of the Womb joins it ſelf to a true Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as taking its riſe from the Redundancy of the nutritive Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, mix'd with much Water; from the Suppreſſion of the Terms, or <hi>Lochia,</hi> or whatever obſtructs the Reflux of the Lymph from the Womb. This Swelling covers the whole Belly equally, and do's not riſe to a top in the middle, as that of a true Conception, and is diſtinguiſh'd from a Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy of the Belly, by the freſh Colour of the Face and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Thirſt. If the Swelling is caus'd by Water, 'tis not ſo dangerous as when it flows from a corrupt Liquor.</p>
                  <p>If the Patient is with Child, little or nothing can be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted; but if otherwiſe, we may boldly uſe convenient Methods to conquer the Diſeaſe: and in the firſt place for a Purgative uſe this Pill. Take Extract of Elaterium twelve Grains; <hi>Mercurius dulcis</hi> fifteen Grains; Troches Alhandal three Grains: Make Pills with Eſſence of Roſemary. The Infuſion or Extract of Spurge-root, or the Infuſion or Syrup of Briony-root given to half an Ounce, are alſo proper:
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:207638:306"/>Vomits are approv'd by all, by reaſon of their ſqueezing Effects. Such things alſo are to be uſed, as provoke the Womb to Excretion, or diſcuſs inſenſibly; ſuch as Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Calamint, Pennyroyal, Sage, and white Onyon with Sugar; alſo Caſtor, Myrrh, Saffron, all Aromatics; <hi>Elixir Proprietatis,</hi> and the Decoction of the Woods.</p>
                  <p>Externally we uſe purgative Peſſaries of <hi>Elaterium</hi> and dry Figs, or of Coloquintida and Extract of Black Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor. Sometimes we inject into the Womb the Decoction of the Leaves of Pennyroyal, Savine, Calamint, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or human Urine, mix'd with Electuary of Hiera; but all will be rendred more effectual, by premiſing Baths and Fomentations of emollient and expelling Ingredients. And if one or both the Lips of the Privity are hydropic, there's nothing better than to foment with Lime-water.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Diſorder relating to Conception, is that of Barrenneſs, occaſion'd by the Indiſpoſition of the <hi>Ovarium,</hi> the narrowneſs of the Trumpets, the defect of the nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Juice of the Egg, the Laxity of the Womb, Diſorders of the external Parts, and other occult Cauſes. And if the Womb be ulcerated, 'tis incurable.</p>
                  <p>As for the Cure; after the univerſal Evacuations, aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Ingredients are proper for ſtrengthening the Womb, and the <hi>Ovarium;</hi> ſuch are Roſemary, Sage, Lavender, Marjo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram, Baum, Pennyroyal, Roots of Burnet, Setwal, and Galangal, Caſſia Lignea, Cardamoms, Nutmegs, and Myrrh. To which, in Cachectic and Scorbutical Caſes, we add Guajacum and Saſſafras, with other Sudorifics.</p>
                  <p>With theſe we join the ſpecific Ingredients, and ſuch as gently provoke Venery, <hi>viz.</hi> Satyrion, Eryngo, Roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket and Muſtard-ſeeds, Moſch, Amber, fleſh of Vipers; the Stones of a Hart or Boar; the Matrix of a Sow, Hare, or Hind, pulveriz'd; the Spirit of Ants; the Pouder of a human Secundine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Externally natural Baths are profitable; or artificial ones of the Decoction of aromatic Ingredients, and that of Ants with their Neſts. Some commend Baths made of Hemlock; or Fumigations with ſweet-ſmelling aromatic Roſins; ſuch as Gum of Juniper, Juniper-berries, Amber, Frankincenſe, Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax, Maſtic, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Peſſaries prepar'd of the bruis'd Leaves of Fever-few, and ſprinkled with a little Oil of Spike.</p>
                  <p>After Barrenneſs we come in order to vitious or deprav'd Conceptions. They are ſaid to be ſuch when the Subject of Conception departs from a human form, and aſſumes that
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:207638:306"/>of other Animals, intitling it to the Character of a Monſter, or continues a ſhapeleſs Lump void of Form, and chriſten'd a <hi>Mola.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The immediate Cauſe of a <hi>Mola</hi> is the Confuſion or Mixture of the nutritious Humour contain'd in the <hi>Chorion,</hi> with that of the Egg; upon which the Tracts of the <hi>Foetus</hi> delineated in the latter are effac'd by the former.</p>
                  <p>If this Confuſion be very early, it generats a watry veſicular <hi>Mola:</hi> If its date be as late as the forming of the Veſſels, and their repletion with Blood, it leaves a fleſhy Lump; which, if the fibrous Threds are already ſpun out, and enrich'd with Spirits, is endow'd with a principal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>This vitious Mixture is oftentimes occaſion'd by violent Motion, Paſſion or Heat.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a difficult thing to diſtinguiſh a <hi>Mola</hi> from a true Conception, eſpecially if a Child accompanies it in the Womb; in which caſe it either kills the Child or cauſes Abortion. However if we carefully obſerve, we may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern a <hi>Mola</hi> by its much greater weight; and by the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of its motion, which is either none at all, or ſuch as by its ſluggiſhneſs is eaſily diſtinguiſh'd from the brisk Motion of a living Child. If it poſſeſs the Womb alone, it general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly putrifies, and entails the like miſchief to the Womb.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all we ought to obſerve carefully whether the <hi>Mola</hi> is join'd with a Child; and if ſo, we muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prevent Abortion, and expect the excluſion of the Child with which the <hi>Mola</hi> is ordinarily expell'd. But if the <hi>Mola</hi> is alone, we muſt endeavour with all convenient ſpeed to procure its ejection: for which purpoſe we muſt uſe firſt preparative, and then expelling Medicines.</p>
                  <p>Preparatives are Baths, Fomentations, Inunctions, Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters both for the Belly and Womb, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of emollient and laxative Ingredients: Womb-Clyſters muſt be of Oil, thoſe for the Belly of Milk.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, a Vein muſt be opened, firſt in the Arm, and then in the Foot; after which we may uſe ſtrong Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits either from Steel or Vitriol; and powerful Purgatives, ſuch as the Faetid Pills, thoſe of Hiera with Colocynth, or the Decoction of Senna, Pennyroyal and Savin in Whey, taken for three days ſucceſſively.</p>
                  <p>To theſe we ſubjoin ſuch Medicines as bring down the Terms, and are intitled to an expulſive Faculty, <hi>viz.</hi> Rue, Mug-wort, Penny-roal, Savin, Briony, Gentian, Aſara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacca,
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:207638:307"/>Dill, Juniper-berries; the Eſſence and Oil of Cloves, the Decoction and diſtill'd Oil of Savin; or a Pouder made of equal Parts, of Borace, Myrrh, Caſtor and volatil Salt of Amber, given to half a Dram in Cinnamom-water twice or thrice a Day for ſome time: the Pouder alſo and Spirit of an After-birth is much commended.</p>
                  <p>Externally alſo, we muſt uſe Clyſters for irritating the <hi>Vagina</hi> and internal Orifice of the Womb, and moving them to convulſive Motions; ſuch are the Decoctions of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyroal, Fever-few, Savine, and Pulp of Coloquintida ty'd in a Bag. Peſſaries and Fumigations from the ſame Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents are alſo proper; but withal let the Patient uſe ſome violent Exerciſe; ſuch as leaping, jumping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to promote the Operation of the Remedies.</p>
                  <p>If all theſe Preſcriptions prove ſucceſsleſs, we muſt have recourſe to a skilful Surgeon, who with a <hi>Speculum <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>teri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> muſt dilate the <hi>Vagina</hi> and internal Orifice of the Womb, and by his Hand or Inſtruments draw out the whole <hi>Mola.</hi> And if after the Extraction, exceſſive Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Pains of the Womb inſue, exhibit the following Electuary.</p>
                  <p>Take Conſerve of Roſes an Ounce; Conſerve of Quinces without the Species half an Ounce; Troches of Amber, ſeal'd Earth, and Spodium, of each half a Dram; Sorrel-ſeed, and burnt Hartſhorn prepar'd, of each a Scruple: With Syrup of Quinces and that of Mint make an Electuary.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>WHILE Women are with Child, they ought to be very cautious of the uſe of the ſix Non-natural things, for fear of incurring the dangers that the ſuppreſſion of their Terms expoſes 'em to, and provoking the Child to an untimely Egreſs.</p>
                  <p>In their Diet let Cuſtom be their Rule, ſince things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted, tho of themſelves proper, are offenſive, and <hi>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>contra.</hi> Summer-fruits, violent Aromatics, and ſtrong Smells, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſweet or foetid, are pernicious. Much Wine and acid Liquors are apt to cauſe Abortion. Violent Motion is alſo dangerous, eſpecially during the firſt Months, tho in the
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:207638:307"/>latter Months if it be moderate 'tis not inconvenient. Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, long Watchings, Fear, Anger, and ſuch-like Paſſions, ought to be avoided. Coſtiveneſs ought to be remov'd by the Pulp of Tamarinds, or Oil of ſweet Almonds; Cream and Salt of Tartar or Rhubarb, mix'd with Carminative-ſeeds. Sometimes potch'd Eggs and Sugar are ſufficient. Proper Purgatives or ſtrong Clyſters are very dangerous. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it will not be amiſs to ſtrengthen the Child by a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat Draught of ſweet Wine after eating, by exhibiting Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namom-water impregnated with Borrage and Quinces; or the Juice, Syrup and Marmalade of Quinces mix'd with Cloves, Mace and Nutmegs; or at Bedtime to apply to the Belly a Bag quilted with Mint, Baum, Ginger, Cloves, Galan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſprinkl'd with the Oil of Citrons, or that of Orange Peel.</p>
                  <p>If a Big-belly'd young and plethoric Woman be ſeiz'd with an acute Diſeaſe, Blooding is not improper; but 'tis better to blood frequently than draw forth much at one time. If her Stomach be diſorder'd, mild Vomits are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable during the firſt four Months: but Purgatives, at leaſt ſuch as in violence ſurpaſs the Laxatives above-mention'd, are always ſuſpected. Narcotics in general threaten the Relaxation of the Fibres of the Womb: But in ſome Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes when the Animal Spirits are much irritated, and ſuch other Circumſtances ſeem to demand it, we may venture to allow a moderat Doſe of Opium.</p>
                  <p>All the peculiar Symptoms of Big-belly'd Women are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd by the Influence of the ſeminal Liquor, the Suppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Terms, and the Sympathy of the Stomac with the diſtended Womb. The firſt is Vomiting, which in the firſt Months ought not to be ſtop'd, for it facilitats Delivery. In the laſt months it is dangerous, and ought to be curb'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times. Toward the middle of their Reckoning, Blood-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting removes it; unleſs they be Cacochymical, in which Caſes the abſorbent Pouders and ſtomachical Ingredients are requir'd: But Steel is hurtful. Externally ſtomachical Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are likewiſe uſeful. To this Symptom we may add a Pica, loathing of Meat, griping of the Guts, which we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for in the firſt Book.</p>
                  <p>A Looſeneſs in the firſt Months is dangerous. Towards the latter end it is of leſs conſequence, unleſs it exceed bounds; upon which account we ought to be very cautious in ſtopping it. If it be accompany'd by a proſtration of Strength, or ſigns of Malignity, and threaten Miſcarriage, let aſtringent
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:207638:308"/>Acids and <hi>Venice</hi> Triacle, or <hi>Diaſcordium</hi> diſſolv'd in acid Vehicles be exhibited, and proper Plaiſters applied external<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but all Purgation is pernicious. The Pains of the Loins, Hip-bones and Pubes, caus'd by the various diſtention of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments of the Womb and the annex'd Membrans, according as the Child is ſeated, forwards or backwards, are remov'd by anointing with the Oil of Earthworms mix'd with diſtill'd Oil of Juniper; or applying the Spirit of Earthworms mix'd with <hi>Aqua Articularis.</hi> The Toothach in Women with Child yields to the common Cure. A Palpitation of the Heart happening to a luſty Woman, about the middle of her Reckoning, is cur'd by Blood-letting, or elſe by the ordinary Method. If a Cough moleſt a Woman with Child, we muſt vary the Cure according to its nature, as in the firſt Book.</p>
                  <p>Child-bearing Women are frequently ſubject to bleedings. If the Blood flow from the <hi>Vagina</hi> of the Womb, it runs gradually, at ſet times without Pain; and ought not to be ſtop'd. If it proceed from within the Womb, it runs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, cauſing Pains in the Loins, and if the Woman or Child be not weak, may be gently moderated by Blooding, and the common Specifics: But if the Child move weakly, and the Woman's Appetite and Strength be dejected, 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to promote Miſcarriage by external Aſſiſtance. If the Blood break forth only at other parts of the Body, it argues a ſcorbutic Diſpoſition of the Blood, which is cured by Chalybeats.</p>
                  <p>A ſuppreſſion of Urine is caus'd by the low Situation of the Child, and its bearing down upon the Bladder, and is cur'd by emollient Ingredients us'd both inwardly and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and by heaving up the Belly upon occaſion of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing water. Proper Diuretics are ſcarce ſafe. A Strangury is cur'd by Laxatives; ſuch as the Syrup of Peach-flowers, and Emulſions, and Decoctions of Marſhmallows with Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins, or of Jujubes and Peach-ſtones. The Cramps that Child-bearing Women are ſubject to, are cur'd after the ordinary Method, eſpecially by external Inunction and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation. The Pain and Chops that moleſt the skin of the Belly, as being caus'd by its diſtention, are remov'd by applying emollient Oils and Mucilages. If the Waters break forth from the Womb, eſpecially from within the <hi>Amnios,</hi> before the time of Delivery, 'tis a dangerous Caſe, and their loſs ought to be repair'd by anointing the Paſſage with emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lient Oils and Ointments. But if the Flux of Water pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed only from the outer Neck of the Womb, and is not
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:207638:308"/>follow'd by the true Pains of Child-birth, 'tis of no great conſequence.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes Cacochymical Big-belly'd Women are troubled with ſwellings of the Feet, which diſappear upon Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, as being remov'd by the Flux of the Loches. If theſe Swellings be very troubleſom, anoint the Legs and Feet with the Oils of Dill and St. <hi>John</hi>'s-wort, and apply a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſm of Chamomil-flowers; or foment 'em with Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime water. If hydropic Tumours invade the external Privity, foment it with Quick-lime Water, and apply a Carminative Cataplaſm. Or if theſe prove ſucceſsleſs, apply Leeches, or ſcarify the Part. If the Veins of the Legs are much ſwell'd, ſo as to threaten a Rupture, anoint 'em with the Ointment of Bay-berries, and tie 'em round with a broad Swathe dip'd into ſome aftringent Decoction. If the Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoids ſwell, anoint with the Oil of the Balſam-Apple, or apply a Cataplaſm of the Pulp of boil'd Apples and Oil of Hoglice.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THE regular Seaſon of Delivery happens about nine ſolar Months after Conception; or after ten pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riodical Revolutions of the uſual Interval of the Fluxes of the Terms. If this time be anticipated, 'tis call'd miſcarrying, ſuppoſing ſtill that the Child is form'd: for if the Egg be evacuated before it be form'd, 'tis call'd Expulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Cauſe of miſcarrying is either the Irritation and Contraction of the Womb, occaſion'd by irregular Paſſions, violent Motion, drinking Wine, eſpecially in the firſt Months, ungrateful ſtrong Smells, external cold, acid Food, the weakneſs or preternatural Situation of the Child, the Diſorders of the Kidneys, Inteſtines, and adjacent Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brans, the Redundancy and Exaltation of the Maſs of Blood; or the Relaxation and Flaggyneſs of the Womb, ariſing from exceſſive Bleeding, want of Spirits, immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat uſe of Opium, ſudden Grief or Fear, a Chronical white Flux, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Signs of imminent Abortion are a heavyneſs about the Loins and Hips, and wandring ſhooting Pains moving
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:207638:309"/>downwards from the Navel. To which we may add a Lazy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Inappetency, the Womb's gathering it ſelf into the form of a Globe incumbent upon the Share-bone, Shiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Tremblings, Palpitations of the Heart, the Efflux of Matter from the Womb, and an involuntary bearing down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> look'd upon the flaggineſs and Extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Breaſts, or their voiding of Milk or Blood, as a ſign of miſcarrying. It prognoſticats Barrenneſs, Bleedings of the Womb, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the Cure of Abortion; if the <hi>Foetus</hi> be already ſeparated, we ought to aſſiſt Nature in the Expulſion; and on the contrary, if Abortion be only threaten'd, we ought to prevent it by Blood-letting, if the Women be pletho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric; or otherwiſe by exhibiting the Decoction or Water of Vervain, the Pouder or Tincture of Chermes-berries, the Pouder or Juice of River-Crabs, or the Tincture of Coral. If the Spirits be much iritated, Opium is allowable. If the Womb be flaggy, let a Cataplaſm of Bdellium and Maſtic diſſolv'd in Vinegar, or a Plaiſter of Galbanum and Tacamahac be applied to the Pubes; or bathe the Parts with an Infuſion of Allum in the firſt Months; or let the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man make uſe of the natural Hot-baths before Impregnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. A Cataplaſm of Yeſt (or Bread bak'd with Pepper) Cloves, Cinnamom, Mace and Wine, applied to the Pubes, is of good uſe againſt all ſorts of Abortions. If Abortion be caus'd by the Paſſions of the Mind or acid ſharp Food, uſe abſorbent Pouders mix'd with Aromatics; Opium cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly uſed, and Fomentations with aſtringent Decoctions are very proper. If it proceed from external Cold, <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi> and ſpirituous Liquors are requir'd. If Swoonings uſher it in, the Tincture of Coral prepar'd with Spirit of Stag's Heart, and the Confection of Hyacinth, are uſeful. A ſerous Cachexy is accounted for by the Decoction of Guaja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum; and the white Flux remov'd by cutting Iſſues in the Legs.</p>
                  <p>If Abortion cannot be prevented, let the Woman after Miſcarrying beware of the leaſt degree of Cold; and let the After-birth be cautiouſly drawn forth by the Midwife, without giving any internal Medicines for that purpoſe, for fear of occaſioning a Flux of Blood, which in this Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Women are very liable to. So much for Abortion.</p>
                  <p>If the Woman is come to her full time, the firſt thing to be conſider'd is, if the Child preſents in a right Poſture, <hi>viz.</hi> the Head firſt; if not, the Midwife muſt endeavour to ſet it right, or elſe to pull it out by the Feet. If the
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:207638:309"/>Poſture be regular, the next Task is to diſtinguiſh between the true and ſpurious Pains of Child-birth; the ſpurious Pains are either Colic, hyſteric or nephritic, which aſſume the form of the true ones, and impoſe upon the Midwives under that cover. They are cur'd by exhibiting the Spirit of Zedoary or Decoction of Cumin-ſeeds in Ale, and rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the Belly and Back with hot Napkins, or fomenting 'em with the Decoction of Carminative and Anodyn Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients; whereas the true ones are rather irritated by that Method, and beſides are attended by theſe Signs, <hi>viz.</hi> the down-falling of the Belly towards the Pubes, the Progreſs of the Pains from the Loins downwards, the opening of the internal Orifice of the Womb, and the diſtention of the Membrans enwrapping the Child. Now 'tis highly perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious for a Woman to bear down or endeavour the Expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Child before the appearance of theſe Signs.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſing then that the true Pains are come upon her, we muſt endeavour to facilitat her Labour. Now the Cauſes of hard Labour are the weakneſs and ſicklineſs of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, her Spirits being exhauſted by ſweating or ſpurious Pains either antecedent or concomitant; her being liable to the Paſſions of Fear, Shame, or whatever cramps her due Efforts, or interrupts or inverts the Motion of her Pains; the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Child, its being intangl'd in the Navel-ſtring, or diſturb'd by a fellow Twin; the hardneſs and thickneſs of the Membrans enwrapping it; the ſtraitneſs or dryneſs of the Paſſages (the former incident to ſtale Maids converted into Wives, the latter following the untimely Efflux of the Waters) the ſtiffneſs and reſiſtence of the Share-bone, and that of the Back call'd Coccyx; the repletion of the Bladder and Inteſtins; Excreſcences in the Womb or neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring parts; extreme Laxity of the Neck of the Womb, diſabling it for Contraction and Expulſion; and a hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pic Tumour in the Child's Head, or its leaning on the Share-bone. In which laſt Caſe the Head ought to be put back by the Midwives hand; otherwiſe all expelling Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines do but augment the Evil.</p>
                  <p>Now in order to prevent ſuch Inconveniencies, a few days before the hour of Delivery, let the Woman bathe in the Decoction of Marſh-mallows, Melilot, Chamomil, Pennyroyal Mug-wort, Wild Thyme, Baum, Fever-few, Seeds of Lint, Fenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grec and Dill; or apply Bags of the ſame Ingredients to her Belly; anointing afterwards her Back, Belly and privy Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages with an Ointment of Mucilages and emollient Oils.
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:207638:310"/>When her Pains are juſt at hand, 'twill not be improper to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject a ſoftning Carminative Clyſter, or exhibit Oil of Olives inwardly, and anoint the Parts frequently. If the Pains are diſcontinu'd, the Woman muſt not be forc'd to bear down. She ought rather to walk a little about; and when the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Womb is open, and the Waters broke, then let her be plac'd on the Stool, and incourag'd to a ſpeedy Delivery. If the Mother or Child be weak, let her take a Glaſs of Cinnamom, Baum, Pennyroyal, or the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound hyſteric Water mix'd with the Syrup of Orange-peel, or of Mugwort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Pains relent, if the Child preſents naturally, and the Waters are broke, and the Orifice of the Womb open'd, we may exhibit aromatic and expelling Medicines, but not otherwiſe. The Aromatics are Dittany of Candy, Sage, Mugwort, Saffron, and eſpecially Cinnamom, which ought never to be omitted. The expelling Specifics are a Draught of the Husband's Urine, or of the Juice of Horſe Dung mix'd with Wine; Caſtor, Oil of Amber given from ten to thirty drops in Pennyroyal Water with a few drops of the Oil of Cinnamom, the volatil Salt of Amber given to fifteen Grains; The Oil of Hazelwood given from fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen to twenty five drops; Troches of Myrrh or <hi>Pilulae Foetidae</hi> given to a Dram; Borace given to a Dram; the Pouder of the Liver of an Eel dry'd together with the Gall-bladder, given to a Dram; the Pouder of the Livers of Vipers, or of Horſes Stones, given to a Dram; Crude Mercury, Fulminatory Gold, and above all the Pouder of a dry'd human After-birth given to a Dram, or its Spirit drawn from it when it has ſtood for a Month in a cloſe Veſſel in a <hi>Balneum Mariae</hi> given to forty Drops: in the room of which we ſometimes make uſe of the Spirit of Soot. If the Pains recur frequently and the Woman be much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigu'd, we may add <hi>Laudanum Opiatum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take of the Pouders of an Eel's Liver, and a human After-birth, of each a Dram; Myrrh or Borace two Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Make a Pouder for three Doſes.</p>
                  <p>Take of the Water of white Lillies two Ounces; Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namom Water half an Ounce; Baum and Pennyroal Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, of each an Ounce; Pouder of Horſe Stones four Scruples; Borace two Scruples; Eſſence of Caſtor, and that of Amber, of each twenty Drops; diſtill'd Oil of Nutmegs ſix Drops; white Sugar two Drams. Mix, and give a Spoonful now and then.</p>
                  <pb n="619" facs="tcp:207638:310"/>
                  <p>Externally apply a Girdle of Snakes Caſt-Coats, or anoint the Belly with an Ointment made of them with Earthworms, and the Juice of River-Crabs, and the fat of a Fox or Hare. Or, Take of the Oil of Wall-flowers ſix Drams; diſtill'd Oil of Amber a Dram. Make an Ointment for the ſame purpoſe. Or, Take of the fat of Vipers ſix Drams; Oil of the Balſam-Apple three Drams; diſtill'd Oil of Spike a Dram. Mix and anoint the Belly, but be ſure to wipe it off after Delivery. Or, Take of Galbanum diſſolv'd in Vinegar an Ounce; Myrrh two Drams; Saffron half a Dram; with Oil of Orris make a Peſſary. Some chooſe to apply a Cataplaſm of the Decoction of Coloquintida, Rue, Myrrh, and Meal of Barley.</p>
                  <p>If all theſe means prove ſucceſleſs, we muſt have recourſe to ſneezing Medicines made of Hellebor, Marjoram, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, Pepper, Caſtor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if theſe be ineffectual, to <hi>Mercurius Vitae</hi> for a Vomit. Sometimes Luſty Women accuſtom'd to drink Wine, or that live in hot Climats, are reliev'd by Blood-letting. If the Mother be ſeiz'd by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions or bleeding from within the Womb, ſhe ought to be immediately laid by a skilful hand. If the Mother be dead, and the Child alive in the Womb, it ought to be cut out.</p>
                  <p>Ofttimes Child-birth is render'd difficult by the Death of the Child in the Womb; in which caſe the ſame expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Medicines are to be us'd, but in larger Doſes. Beſides the external Applications already injoin'd, ſome recommend a Fumigation of the Womb with the Smoak of rotten Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries thrown into boiling Water, or with the Smoak of Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches made of Myrrh, Caſtor, Snakes Caſt-Coats, Pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on's Dung, Madder-roots, and Ox Gall thrown upon burning Coals. If all the means above-mention'd fall ſhort of expelling the dead Child, it muſt be pull'd out either all in one piece by hooks, or cut into ſeveral Pieces.</p>
                  <p>This Symptom of a dead Child ought to be carefully mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not only about the time of Delivery, but during the whole Courſe of the Woman's being with Child, for fear of Miſtakes in giving Aſtringents to prevent miſcarrying, when 'tis actually dead; or of indeavouring its Expulſion as being dead, while 'tis yet alive. Now to prevent ſuch Miſtakes, the following Signs will be of uſe. When the Child is quite dead, neither the Mother nor Midwife are ſenſible of the leaſt Motion: The Mother's Share-bone, Lips, Face and extreme Parts are cold; her Breaſts that were turgid, are now become flaccid, and their Milk ſerous;
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:207638:311"/>ſhe is ſeiz'd with a violent Shivering and Yauning, Swoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſometimes a Feaver, pain of the Head and Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac, and diſmal Convulſions; her pains intermit of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; the Membran of the Child's Head is flaccid, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Excrements come forth before the Child. In proceſs of time her Breath becomes fetid, and Water or corrupt Matter drops from the Womb. If the Child be alive, it will move when the Womb is fomented with vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil Liquors, when the Mother holds her hand in hot Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for ſome time, when a green Leaf of Marjoram bruis'd, or ones hand wet with cold Water, or Bread ſoak'd in Spaniſh Wine, is applied to the Belly, and a Vein open'd in the Leg. If it do not, you may conclude that 'tis dead.</p>

                  <head>SECT. VIII. <hi>Of the Management of Women in Childbed.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>AFTER the Woman is laid, let her be wrap'd up with a Swathe of Linen about the Ribs, and carefully arm'd againſt Cold, Anger, Fear, and ſtrong Smells. Let her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from ſleep for ſome hours, and take a Glaſs of warm Wine with a Toſte for ſtrengthening, quenching Thirſt, and preventing the Symptoms that ofttimes inſue. After ſome hours, ſhe may take a potch'd Egg, with Cinnamom or Zedoary; or ſome Drops of the Tincture of Coral prepar'd with the Spirit of a Stag's Heart. After three or four days, if ſhe be very Coſtive, her Belly may be open'd with Balls of Civet, or Clyſters, or <hi>Elixir Proprietatis,</hi> taken inwardly.</p>
                  <p>The moſt material Circumſtance relating to a Woman in Childbed, is the ſeparation of the Secundine; for if any part of it remain, it putrifies and produces tragical Effects. The Cauſes of its retention are the Influence of cold Air; the Tumour and ſtraitneſs of the internal Neck of the Womb; the Corruption or breaking of the Navel-ſtring, by which 'tis generally pull'd out; and the firm adheſion of the Secundine to the Womb. Sometimes indeed if it be united with the Womb, and receive nouriſhment directly from it without the Foetus, it may remain unputrify'd in the Body. But for the moſt part its Nutrition is receiv'd from the Foetus, and its Adheſion is occaſion'd by the early Egreſs of the Child, or want of due Motion in the Mother, or by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:207638:311"/>Violence. The Symptoms that attend it are an acute Feaver, Pain and ſwelling of the Belly, Gripings about the Region of the Womb, a ſtinking Breath, difficult Reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and voiding of corrupt matter or Blood from the Womb. If it continue long, it may occaſion Ulcers and Gangrens.</p>
                  <p>In order to prevent this Inconvenience, the Midwife ought to tie the Navel-ſtring to the Woman's Thigh, till ſhe be ready to draw forth the Afterbirth: And then the Mother ought to be incourag'd to promote its Egreſs, by Sneezing, Coughing, and in Caſe of Extremity, Vomiting. If all prove ineffectual, let the expelling Medicines abovementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd be adminiſtred; eſpecially the Spirit and Pouder of a human Secundine, Myrrh, Saffron, Amber, Caſtor, and Borace. If the After-birth be already corrupted in the Womb, exhibit <hi>Elixir Proprietatis,</hi> extracted with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Venice</hi> Triacle camphoris'd. In the interim, let ſharp irritating Clyſters be injected; and Peſſaries of expelling Ingredients put up into the Womb. <hi>Glauberus</hi> orders a Mixture of Sal Armoniac and Salt of Tartar to be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Glaſs with a long Neck thruſt into the Womb. Some anoint the parts with the Oils of Coloquintida, Wall-flowers, Savine, Amber, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and order Fumigations of Myrrh, Cinnamom, Galbanum, Caſtor, Opoponax, and Black Hellebor form'd into Troches with Cow's Gall. If theſe Preſcriptions are ſtill ſucceſsleſs, the Midwife muſt put her hand into the Womb, and draw it out; or if that cannot be done, its Putrification muſt be promoted by injecting emollient Decoctions of Marſhmallows, Pellitory of the Wall, Chamomil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> mix'd with Aloes, Myrrh, Oil of Roſes, and Vinegar of Wine; to which we may add Lime-water, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Baſilicon,</hi> and a ſmall quantity of that call'd <hi>Aegyptiacum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the Expulſion of the After-birth, the next ſtep is to regulate the Flux of the <hi>Lochia,</hi> or the Child-bed Purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If they are deficient, we ought to conſider if they are not voided ſome other way, as by the Noſtrils, Stool, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In which Caſe we ought not to diſturb Nature, unleſs grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Symptoms oblige us. Beſides, if the Woman was wont to void but a ſmall quantity of her monthly Courſes, or if ſhe ſuckle the Child, we are not to expect ſo large an Evacuation as otherwiſe. The natural Method of this Flux is ſuch, that Blood is voided four days after Delivery; from thence a watry Liquor like the waſhing of Fleſh till the ſeventh
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:207638:312"/>day; after that a viſcous and ſerous Humour, untainted with Blood, continues to flow till the fourteenth or twentieth day. Now the Cauſes of the Suppreſſion of this Flux are external Cold, drinking cold Liquors, Anger, Fear, Grief, Shame; and the Collection of clotted Blood or viſcid Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in the Womb. The Symptoms of a Suppreſſion, are the Diſtention, Hardneſs, and Pain of the Belly, a beating Heat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Loins and Groin, a ſhivering Feaver, Headach, difficult Reſpiration, Swooning, cold Sweats, Doating, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Death. If the Womb be inflam'd; if a Pleuriſy, Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, or ſpitting of Blood inſue, 'tis a dangerous Caſe.</p>
                  <p>As for the Cure of a Suppreſſion of the <hi>Lochia,</hi> if the Blood and Feaver boil high; if Headachs, difficult Reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and ſuch like Symptoms of the upper Region moleſt the Perſon, let a Vein be open'd in the Arm; and after the uſe of ſome internal Expellent, open the <hi>Saphaena;</hi> or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Leeches to the <hi>Vagina,</hi> or ſcarifying Cupping-glaſſes to the inſide of the Thighs. The internal Medicines are thoſe of an expelling Virtue, recommended above; eſpecially Myrrh, Saffron, Borace, Amber, Zedoary, and <hi>Elixir Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietatis.</hi> If the Blood be clotted, Caſtor and <hi>Sperma Caeti,</hi> with Crabs-eyes and Wine, are proper; to which we may add ſome Grains of <hi>Laudanum Opiatum</hi> in caſe of violent Headachs and other Pains. Externally let the <hi>Abdomen</hi> be fomented with the Decoctions of Chamomil, Savine, and wild Thyme; and anointed with a Mixture of the Oil of Wall-flowers, and the diſtill'd Oils of Cumin, Juniper-berries and Amber; applying afterwards a hot Brick, or a Bag (either dry or boil'd in Wine) of Wormwood, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momil, Fever-few, <hi>Angelica</hi>-roots, the four great hot Seeds, and Juniper-berries. If the Urine be alſo ſtop'd, apply to the lower Belly a Cataplaſm of Chervil, Pellitory of the Wall, and Oil of Scorpions. In the mean while it will not be improper to inject Clyſters of the Decoctions of Specifics for the Womb, and ſtimulating Ingredients; and to order Fumigations from Coloquintida, the Droſs of the <hi>Regulus</hi> of Antimony, Troches of Myrrh, Bdellium, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some put into the <hi>Vagina</hi> a little Bag of black Hellebor. In a word, this Symptom and that of a Suppreſſion of the Terms require the ſame Cure.</p>
                  <p>Inſtead of a Suppreſſion of the <hi>Lochia,</hi> ſometimes we meet with an immoderat Flux of Blood, attended by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Strength, dimneſs of Sight, tingling of the Ears, and Swooning. If the Blood be of an obſcure and
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:207638:312"/>blackiſh Colour, it proceeds from the Veins; if its Colour be florid, and a yellowiſh ſcarlet, it comes from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and portends Danger. The Cauſes are, 1. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundancy and watry thinneſs of the Blood. 2. Its Turgeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and accelerated Motion occaſion'd by the abuſe of ſpirituous Liquors in time of Labour, or the adminiſtration of expelling Medicines. 3. The Wounds of the Womb caus'd by the violent pulling of the After-birth in caſe of miſcarrying, or of its firm Adheſion to the Womb. 4. The Irritation of the Womb occaſion'd by a <hi>Mola,</hi> or Clots of Blood, or pieces of the After-birth remaining.</p>
                  <p>The Cure is vary'd according to the reſpective Cauſe: If the Blood be thin, Sudorifics and Incraſſating Ingredients are proper. If it be overturgid, Purſlain, Plantane, Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentil, Looſtrife and Acids take place. If the Womb be wounded, the Decoctions of Chervil and vulnerary Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients are recommended. If a <hi>Mola</hi> or Pieces of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-birth remaining cauſe an immoderat Flux, we muſt be cautious of uſing ſtrong Expellents, becauſe they promote the Flux: But Aromatic Ingredients mix'd with Aſtringents, may be ſafely adminiſtred. Such are Tormentil, Biſtort, Marjoram, Pennyroyal, Mugwort, Troches of Amber, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In general all Preparations from Quinces; the Pouder of Sea-horſe Teeth (given to a Dram) the Preparations of Steel, Blood-ſtone, ſeal'd Earth, burnt Hartſhorn, the ſolar Tincture of Steel given to fifteen Drops, and the Tincture of the Sulphur of Vitriol given to thirty, Conſerve of Roſes and that of Comfry-roots, with <hi>Laudanum Opiatum;</hi> and in caſe of extremity, Allum given to half a Dram: Theſe, I ſay, are generally approv'd in all Caſes. Externally apply Cupping-glaſſes under the Breaſts, or foment the Breaſts and Genitals, with a cold Mixture of Vinegar, Juice of Houſleek, Nitre, and Water of Frogs Spawn; or apply a Cataplaſm of Soot, Vinegar of Roſes, and the Whites of Eggs, to the Loins. Some order Decoctions of aſtringent Ingredients and Hogs Dung in Smith's Water, to be injected into the Womb. Others recommend a Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of black Hellebor-leaves ty'd round the Body. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundancy and Turgeſcence of the Blood admits of bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Arm, but no other Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>With reference to the Extraction of the After-birth, and Regulation of the Child-bed Flux, we ought to take notice of the After-pains, that ofttimes ſucceed to Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Theſe After-pains are call'd genuin, when they'r ſeated
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:207638:313"/>in the Womb, as being only a Continuation of its Contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and expulſive Endeavours, occaſion'd by the irritation of the Womb from cold, Wind, clotted Blood, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of the After-birth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or its being wounded by ſharp humours, or a violent tearing of the Secundine. They are ſtyl'd ſpurious when they'r lodg'd in the Guts, and aſſume the form of Colic Pains. The genuin ones are confin'd to the lower Belly, and move downward; whereas the others are more floating, and direct their Courſe upward, eſpecially towards the left <hi>Hypochondrium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If theſe Pains proceed from Cold, we order a Fumiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Womb with Nutmegs; if from clotted Blood, we adminiſter the Decoction of Chervil and <hi>Sperma Caeti</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. If they occaſion a Suppreſſion of the <hi>Lochia,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ro the Irritation and Conſtriction of the Neck of the Womb, let the Tincture of Tartar, and Eſſence of Myrrh be exhibited. If the Excoriation of the Womb gave root to 'em, the Oil of Sweet Almonds, and vulnerary Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons mix'd with Chalybeats give relief.</p>
                  <p>In general the Decoction, Spirit and diſtill'd Oil of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momil is univerſally approv'd as an admirable Specific againſt all after-Pains: To which we add ofttimes <hi>Elixir Proprieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</hi> Zedoary, Mug-wort, Caſtor, the Pouder of a human Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-birth, and the Carminative-ſeeds are likewiſe proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients. In the laſt Extremity we are oblig'd to have recourſe to <hi>Laudanum Opiatum.</hi> Externally we foment the Womb with the Decoction of Mugwort; and anoint it with the Oils of Chamomil, Wall-flowers, Cumin, Dill, Earth-worms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and apply the Plaiſter of Galbanum call'd Matricale, or carminative Cataplaſms. As for ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Pains, we treat 'em as Colics.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes Women in Child-bed are ſeiz'd with a Drou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyneſs, Swooning and Anxiety about the Stomac and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condria, which in effect are the Symptoms of a hyſteric Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and are remov'd by volatil Salts, as Caſtor, Spirit of Sal Armoniac, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Antihyſteric Clyſters. But if theſe Symptoms are attended by a Difficulty of Breathing, they threaten an acute Feaver, which forbids Clyſters, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a much different Cure; of which more anon. The Convulſions of Women in Childbed are generally retainers to this hyſteric Paſſion, or the Suppreſſion of the <hi>Lochia,</hi> and are cur'd by Myrrh and Caſtor, join'd to ſuccinat Spirit of Hartſhorn, and abſorbent Pouders.</p>
                  <pb n="625" facs="tcp:207638:313"/>
                  <p>Sometimes hard Labour cauſes Excoriations, Tumors, or Rents on the Privity. The firſt and laſt are cur'd by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying a Liniment of the Oil of St. <hi>John</hi>'s-wort, Balſam of Peru, and Yelks of Eggs; the ſecond by fomenting with the Decoction of Chamomil and Elder-flowers in Wine and Water, and applying a warm Cataplaſm of freſh Brook-lime and Chamomil-flowers beaten together. If the Capacity of the <hi>Vulva</hi> be ſo inlarg'd that the Rent paſſes through the <hi>Perinae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> let the Woman avoid all motion of coughing, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the following Glue to the Lips of the Wound.</p>
                  <p>Take of Comfry-roots two Drams; Bole Armenic, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtic, Dragon's Blood, Sarcocol, fine Flower and Pompholix, of each a Dram. With Roſin of the Pine-tree and the Whites of Eggs make a gluy Subſtance. If the Lips of the Wound are already cover'd with Scars, we treat it the ſame way as a Hair Lip. If it be inflam'd and tend to a Gangrene, we cut off the corrupt part, waſh the ſound Fleſh with Lime-water, and cover it with the Balſam of Sulphur.</p>
                  <p>If the Woman in Child-bed be Coſtive, or troubled with the dry Piles, exhibit a very gentle Laxative, and foment the <hi>Anus</hi> with emollient Decoctions. If a Looſeneſs ſeize her while the <hi>Lochia</hi> are ſuppreſs'd, it ought not to be ſtopp'd any other way than by adminiſtring Specifics for retrieving the Flux of the <hi>Lochia:</hi> But if their Flux con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, or if an acute Feaver attend the Looſneſs, it ought to be curb'd betimes, by exhibiting Sudorifics and proper Specifics againſt Looſneſſes, and applying to the Navel or Stomac the Oil of Amber mix'd with the diſtill'd Oil of Mace. If the Sphincter of the Bladder be ſo relaxated by the diſtention of Childbirth, or the roughneſs of the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife's Hands, that the Woman cannot retain her Urine, ſhe muſt foment the Parts with aromatic and aſtringent Decoctions, and hang the Pouder of Toads in a Bag over her Breaſt, or have recourſe to the natural Hot-baths. If Clots of Blood collected in the Paſſage for Urine, occaſion its Suppreſſion, let the Pubes be anointed with Oil of Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions; and the Decoction of Chervil, Chamomil and <hi>Sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Ceti</hi> be us'd both inwardly and outwardly. If hard Labour occaſion wrinkles in the Belly, let it be anointed with a Liniment of the Oil of Nutmegs, <hi>Sperma Ceti,</hi> Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron and Wax.</p>
                  <p>The remaining Diſorders incident to Women in Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, are the Milk-feaver and acute Diſeaſes. The occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:207638:314"/>of the former is this. The nutritious Juice that was wont to be meaſur'd out for the Child in the Womb, ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nats in the Blood after Delivery, and about the fourth day raiſes a feaveriſh Thirſt and Fermentation; by virtue of which 'tis precipitated into the Breaſts, and converted into Milk, while the remaining Recrements are voided by a natural Sweat about the ſeventh day. If this Feaver be troubleſome, 'tis alleviated by promoting the Flux of the <hi>Lochia,</hi> eſpecially if the Woman do not deſign to ſuckle her Child; as the fix'd Salts with Diaphoretic Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Myrrh, or gentle Sudorifics, will anſwer thoſe who make account to ſuckle. In general there's nothing more friendly to Women in Childbed, than continued breathing Sweats. If anxiety and difficulty of breathing attend this Feaver, we muſt have recourſe to the expelling Emulſions of the Seeds of Turneps, Columbines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Breaſts be hard and moleſted with pain, foment 'em with the Spirit of Sal Armoniac and the Eſſence of Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron; and apply a Plaiſter of Saffron and Galbanum.</p>
                  <p>The acute Diſeaſes of Women in Childbed are for the moſt part malignant, and uſher'd in by malign Symptoms. If a Feaver is occaſion'd by a Suppreſſion of the <hi>Lochia,</hi> we muſt endeavour to recover their Flux. If the <hi>Lochia</hi> continue to run, we muſt be cautious of exhibiting ſtrong Sudorifics againſt the Feaver, for fear of occaſioning an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely Suppreſſion. But withal remember to keep it within bounds, and reſtrain it if there be occaſion, leſt the Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſhould gain force by the exceſſive loſs of Blood. In general, the Cure is perform'd by avoiding the leaſt degree of cold, and taking Sudorifics, ſuch as Mineral Bezoar, Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Purging, Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Blooding and ſweet Syrups are generally noxious; eſpecially if the Feaver be very malignant, attended by a tingling of the Ears, heavyneſs of the Head, difficulty of Breathing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Tho the Perſon be moleſted with Thirſt, Acids ought to be cautiouſly us'd, by reaſon that they may provoke the Womb, or ſtop the Childbed Flux. The Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Hartſhorn and Juice of Citrons, or the Tincture of Columbine and Blewbottle-flowers, and ſuch like temperat Acids are the beſt. If the Perſon be frequently ſeiz'd with
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:207638:314"/>ſlight Shiverings, and little pricking Pains in the Back, 'tis a ſign of miliar Eruptions, which if they be white are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. Before their Eruption, abſorbent Diaphoretics are proper; after their appearance, Emulſions of the expulſive Seeds, the antiſcorbutic Tincture of Coral, and the Eſſence of Myrrh, ought to be added.</p>

                  <p>THE nutritious Juice that was wont to be meaſur'd out for the Child in the Womb, ſtagnats in the Blood when the Womb is empty'd and contracted. This Stagnation is follow'd by a Fermentation, or Milk-feaver, and that by a Precipitation of Serum, which being ſtrain'd thro the Glandules of the Breaſts, and thicken'd by their acid Ferment, is converted into Milk, and fitted for the Nouriſhment of new-born Infants. The Accidents which thwart Nature in this its Deſign, are ſuch as either impair or over-mul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iply the quantity of Milk, or elſe deprave it.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe which impair the quantity of Milk, are the artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Compreſſion, or preternatural Obſtruction of the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules and Paſſages in the Breaſts; the meagre dry Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Woman's Body; much ſweating, or voiding large quantities of white Serum in the Childbed Flux; drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of acid Liquors, or auſtere Wine; Grief, Fear, Anger and Childbed acute Diſeaſes; to which we may add the want of a ſucking Force in a weak Child. Now in order to ſupply Milk, we order juicy Food, and the Decoction of Elder-flowers in Milk, or that of Earth-worms and Fennel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeds, for drink. The Seeds of Anis, Caraways and Dill, or their diſtill'd Oils, are alſo very proper. Prepar'd Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal and Marle from Rocks, indirectly promote the increaſe of Milk, by ſubduing the Acid that thwarts it. Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally we order the Breaſts to be rubb'd with a rough Cloth after eating, and fomented with the Decoction of Fennel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeds, Marſhmallows, Mint, and Elder-flowers in Milk; or anointed with the Oil of Worms, mix'd with a few Drops of the diſtill'd Oil of Anis; and cover'd with a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſm of the Meal of Barly, Marſhmallows and Yeſt.</p>
                  <pb n="628" facs="tcp:207638:315"/>
                  <p>Contrary to this Symptom is the Redundancy of Milk caus'd by the Laxity of the Glandules in the Breaſts, or the over-acting of a volatil Acid which promotes the Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is follow'd by a diſtention of the Breaſts, pain in the Back, ſwelling of the Glandules under the Arm-pits, and ſometimes a Corruption of the Breaſts, if it ſtagnate there; or by an univerſal Weakneſs, if it be evacuated. If it coagulat and diſtend the Breaſts, we endeavour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote its Egreſs by ſucking, and applying the Plaiſter of <hi>Sperma Ceti,</hi> and above that, hot Bags quilted with Millet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeds, Rice and Barly. If the Milk be free from Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in the Breaſts, we foment 'em with the Decoction of Mint, Hemlock, Cumin-ſeeds, and Allum in Water and Vinegar; or apply Cataplaſms of the Pouder of Mint, Bread, Vinegar and Salt. Some commend the Juice of Plantane, and the Plaiſter of Hemlock. Internally we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the cold Antivenereal Specifics.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the Deficiency and Redundancy of Milk, there remains yet another Diſorder relating to the ſame Claſs, <hi>viz.</hi> its Corruption or Curdling, occaſion'd either ſuddenly by the quick Retreat and Perturbation of the Animal Spirits through Grief and Fear, or gradually by its mixing with acid Lymph in the Glandules of the Breaſts, and lingring beyond its due time. The Symptoms of curdled Milk are the <hi>unequal</hi> Swellings of the Glandules of the Breaſts, at firſt free of pain, but afterwards follow'd by a violent Heat, Redneſs, pinching Pain, and Inflammation that perhaps degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats into Impoſthums, Fiſtula's, Schirrus's or Cancers. The Cure, which ought to commence betimes, conſiſts in diſcuſſing the Swellings, and diſſolving the curdled Milk, or elſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting its Suppuration. The Diſcuſſion is obtain'd by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inwardly <hi>Sperma Ceti</hi> to a Dram; or Crabs-eyes and Myrrh, with Diaphoretic Antimony and fixed Salts; or the Pouder of Woodlice to a Dram; or the Spirit of Sal Armoniac to a Dram; in order to ſweat. After ſweating we apply a large quantity of the Plaiſter of <hi>Sperma Ceti,</hi> and cover it above with hot Bags of Rice, Millet-ſeeds and Barly; or if that Plaiſter be ineffectual, that of Galbanum with Saffron cover'd in like manner, the Breaſt being bath'd twice a day with a Mixture of the Spirit of Sal Armoniac, Eſſence of Saffron and ordinary Spirit of Wine.</p>
                  <p>If the Breaſts be much inflam'd or ſeiz'd with St. <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>'s Fire, the Woman is moleſted with feaveriſh Shiverings, and a beating Pain in the middle of the Swelling. In this
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:207638:315"/>caſe let the Milk be forcibly ſuck'd; let the Decoctions of Mint and Chervil, with the above-mention'd Sudorifics, be adminiſtred; and Hony ſpread upon gray or blew Paper be apply'd to the Breaſts. The Phlegm of Vitriol ſtrip'd of Acidity, the Water of Frogs Spawn, and eſpecially that of Quick-lime, are very uſeful for external Fomentation. Some order River-Crabs bruis'd to be applied to the Breaſts: But above all, a Cataplaſm of the Meal of Beans, Lentils and Lupins, boil'd in Vinegar and Water, and mix'd with the Whites of Eggs, is moſt effectual. For St. <hi>Antony</hi>'s Fire, let the Syrup of Elder ſpread upon a Linen Cloth be applied to the Breaſts, and renewed every hour.</p>
                  <p>If Diſcuſſives prove ſucceſsleſs, we muſt endeavour to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the Swelling, by bathing it twice a day with Eſſence of Saffron and Spirit of Sal Armoniac mix'd; and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Mynſichtius</hi>'s Plaiſter of <hi>Galbanum</hi> with Saffron mix'd with <hi>Diachylon.</hi> 'Tis uſual to apply Cataplaſms of the Juice of Smallage, Juice of Sheeps-dung, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But they generally create pain. Perhaps the following Cataplaſm may not be amiſs.</p>
                  <p>Take of the Roots of Orris, roſted Onyons, of each three Ounces; Yeſt two Ounces; Yelks of Eggs in number three; freſh Hogs Tallow half an Ounce; Oil of Roſes, Meal of Beans and Linſeed, of each two Ounces. Make a Cataplaſm.</p>
                  <p>When the Swelling becomes ſoft, it ought to be open'd with a Lance, becauſe tho the Glandule and Fat be eaſily diſſolv'd by the purulent matter, yet 'tis not able to break through the Skin without inſufferable pains. After 'tis open, apply Tents cover'd with Balſam of Peru, or Oil of the Balſamin Apple, Oil of St. <hi>John</hi>'s-wort, or the common Digeſtive of Turpentine, Hony and Yelks of Eggs; or above all, the Oil of Man's Ordure. In caſe of a Fiſtula, waſh it with the Decoction of Agrimony, Allum, and Myrrh, and apply the following Ointment.</p>
                  <p>Take of the Juice of Agrimony an Ounce; Aloes, Myrrh, Sarcocol, and plumous Allum, of each a Dram. With Hony make an Ointment.</p>
                  <p>Ofttimes theſe Swellings elude the Operation both of diſcuſſing and ſuppurating Medicines, and become hard painleſs Scrofles or Schirrus's; the former ariſing from curd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Milk, the latter from clotted Blood fix'd by a powerful Acid, after the Inflammation. In this Caſe Gum Ammoniac, Galbanum, the Plaiſter of Hemloc, and a Liniment of the Juice
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:207638:316"/>of Nightſhade with Lytharge are proper for external Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. If we are apprehenſive of their Degeneracy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Cancer, a Cataplaſm of the Juice of Earthworms, Pulp of rotten Apples, Turneps, Figgs and Saffron, will not be improper. But if the Swellings begin to ſhoot and cauſe pain, they are not to be meddled with; as being near akin to Cancers.</p>
                  <p>Cancers in the Breaſt generally take their Riſe from hard Swellings, and are much incourag'd by the Suppreſſion of the Terms. When the Swelling ſhoots and pricks without a tendency to Suppuration; when it becomes hot and livid, and the Veins are ſwollen, we may reaſonably conclude up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Cancer. Sometimes, but very rarely, it comes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any viſible precedent Cauſe, and appears firſt in the form of a little red Knot, about the bigneſs of a Chiche, which by derees increaſes, becomes livid and black, and the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding Veins ſwell up like ſo many Crabs-feet.</p>
                  <p>If a Cancer lies hid within its own Verge, and dos not yet corrode the Skin and Subſtance of the Breaſts, it ought not to be tamper'd with. For a palliative Cure we apply Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niments which partake of Ceruſs and the Sugar of Lead, or a Plate of Lead to the Breaſts. The Juice of the prick Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle call'd <hi>Onopordon,</hi> or of the Herb <hi>Robert,</hi> and the Juice or Water of rotten Apples, are alſo proper for external Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications. Note, all Compoſitions againſt a Cancer ought to be beaten and mix'd in a Leaden Mortar.</p>
                  <p>If a Cancer be ulcerated, and void corrupt matter diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing its Venom round all the neighbouring Parts, it ought to be rooted out with a Knife, and the bleeding ſtop'd with a fir'd Iron. <hi>Allioth</hi> pretended to cure it with Alcali's mix'd with Sulphur. But the former Method is moſt univerſally receiv'd. Some apply a living Crab which dies upon the Breaſt while the Virulency remains; and if it live, ſignifies the temperance of the Ferment. This Application they repeat till the Crab be able to live upon the Breaſt. Soot and Lime-water are alſo recommended for waſhing the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, as likewiſe the following Ointment. Take of the Juices of Golden Rod, Nightſhade, and Sow-thiſtle, of each an Ounce; Oil of Violets, and that of Roſes, of each an Ounce and a half. With Quick-lime make an Ointment in a Leaden Mortar.</p>
                  <p>The laſt Diſorder relating to Suckling ſhall be that of the Nipples; when they are ſmall and not open, or chop'd and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lcerated. The former Inconvenience is amended by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:207638:316"/>a Cupping glaſs or a glaſs Inſtrument fit for the purpoſe, and ſuckling a toothleſs Puppy. The latter is prevented by fitting an excavated Nutmeg to the Nipple, or anointing it with Hogs Tallow mix'd with common Bole, ſome time before Delivery. Its actual Cure is compaſs'd by anointing with Balſam of Peru, or Oil of Balſamin Apple mix'd with the Oil of Eggs. The Oil of Sugar, the fat of Cockles, the Juice of the Herb <hi>Robert,</hi> and above all, the Juice of Wood-lice expreſs'd in Wine, are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd for the ſame purpoſe. Some apply ſton'd Raiſins, or the Leather of ones Shooe: But when the Chops are large, they ought to be waſhed frequently with warm Water to take off the ſtagnating Milk and Serum that corrupts and galls the Nipples; and then fomented with Plantain-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in which Sugar of Lead is diſſolv'd; and afterwards co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd up with a leaf of Ground Ivy. If they be ulcerated, waſh them with Quicklime-water; and anoint 'em with a mixture of Litharge, Allum, Myrrh, and Oil of Roſes.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IN the foregoing Sections we conducted the Child from the firſt minute of Conception, to the hour of Birth. It remains now to view its Circumſtances, when juſt launch'd into the World, and provide ſuitable Relief. The firſt Alteration it undergoes, is occaſion'd by the free Air which rarifies and quickens the Blood and Spirits, and by conſequence provokes the Stomac, Guts, and Bladder to expulſive Contractions. Now in imitation of Natures Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, 'tis the Duty of Art to promote theſe Evacuations by exhibiting ſmall quantities of a Mixture of ſolutive Syrup of Roſes, Syrup of Cichory with Rubarb, and <hi>Sala</hi>'s Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Syrup; and feeding it with the Beeſtings projected by Nature for that purpoſe: For the Excrements lodg'd in the firſt Paſſages, are the curdled, acid, nutritious Juice barr'd from Evacuation 'till Child-birth; hence the voiding of 'em before Delivery is look'd upon as a Sign of a dead Child: And their undue ſtay after the Birth taints the nouriſhment with a preternatural Acidity, and is in good
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:207638:317"/>meaſure the Cauſe of all the tragical Symptoms that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue our Infancy; upon which account we ought to be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in endeavouring their early removal.</p>
               <p>Nor is the inſenſible Tranſpiration or Evacuation by the Pores of the skin to be neglected, as being ſo eſſential to Life. Now the ſlimy Cruſt faſten'd upon the Skin by the Liquor in the <hi>Amnios,</hi> deprives the Infants of this Benefit, and by impriſoning the Steams under the Skin expoſes 'em to cuticular Eruptions. To remove this inconvenience the Nurſe ought to bathe the Child very frequently in warm Water, in which Soap or common Lye is diſſolv'd; and with a ſoft Cloth wipe off the impurities of the Womb.</p>
               <p>As the undue Retention of Excrements is frequently the Cauſe of Childrens Diſeaſes, ſo the Aſſumption of irregular Food is juſtly charg'd with the ſame Crime. The moſt of their Food is Milk from the Breaſts, which is render'd diſorderly ſeveral ways. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. When 'tis not the Mother's own Milk. The nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Juice which the Child was acquainted with in the Womb, being converted into Milk, would be the moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and eaſy nouriſhment; ſince Cuſtomary Food is always moſt eaſy of Digeſtion. But foraſmuch as the temperament of every Woman varies the Milk; that of a ſtrange Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man muſt needs diſagree with the nutritious Juice of the Mother, which the Child was wont to digeſt, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cauſes ſeveral notable Alterations in its Body; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering that our Hackney Nurſes are generally poor and inur'd to coarſe Food, whereas the Mothers that hire 'em are intitled to a contrary Character.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Milk of a ſickly Woman, whether Mother or Nurſe, is improper.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Fat thick Milk at firſt, is pernicious to the Child, and apt to curdle into an acid Crudity. Nature has wiſely provided againſt this Conſequence by the thin purgative Beeſtings that prepare the Child's Stomac, and by degrees inable it to digeſt the thick elaborate Milk.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Nothing is more apt to diſorder the Child than ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it too often; ſince large quantities of Milk ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating in the Stomac, muſt needs corrupt and occaſion Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, eſpecially if freſh Milk be pour'd in before the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding be digeſted.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Nurſe's irregular Conduct dos frequently vitiat the Milk. The leaſt Error in Diet, tho inoffenſive to her, may taint the Milk and hurt the Child. Upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:207638:318"/>ſhe ought to eat roaſted Meat, and that moderatly, and not over-charge her Stomac, as many are wont to do, when they'r tranſplanted from their own hungry Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to a fat Paſture. In particular ſhe ought to avoid Acids, Sweetmeats, Cheeſe, Wine, Summer-fruits, or whatever is apt to curdle and clot the Milk. And as her Diet ought to be clean and regular, ſo ſhe ought to preſerve a calm diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionat temper of Mind; ſince Fear, Anger, and Grief, clot the Milk by diverting and withdrawing the Spirits that ſhould keep up its equal temperature: Nay the influence of Fear and other Paſſions is viſible in the natural Marks that are intail'd to Children in the Mother's Womb, by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Motion of the Mother's Spirits determin'd upon one part; and (by the way) theſe Marks are cur'd by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frequently a hot bloody Secundine, or Clouts dip'd in Menſtrual Blood, and the touch of a dead Child's hand. Some apply Clouts dip'd in the Blood of Toads, or <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi>'s <hi>Aqua Divina,</hi> or in caſe of extremity cut 'em off.</p>
               <p>If Fear or Paſſion actually prevail and cauſe the Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Milk, let the deprav'd Milk be firſt ſuck'd out by a Puppy, and the Medicines recommended againſt the ſame Symptoms in the foregoing Book, be exhibited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Child be admitted to ſuck. In general the curd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Milk is beſt prevented by eating Aniſe and Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel-ſeeds after Meals, and abſtaining from cold drink, or avoiding any external Cold; eſpecially by diverting the menſtrual Purgation, and ſhunning the Emotions of Venery, which by curdling the Milk in the Child's Stomac frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entail to it an Antipathy againſt Cheeſe, as being a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reſemblance of the curdled Milk that was wont to annoy it.</p>
               <p>After the Child has ſuck'd about a year it ought to be wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, eſpecially a little after the Equinoxes, during the increaſe of the Moon. The chief Inconvenience Children are liable to, is drinking in the Nighttime, which ſwells up their Belly, and occaſions Looſeneſſes and many other bad Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms. To prevent this, let the Eſſence of Wormwood be mix'd with their drink; or if theſe Evils prevail already, exhibit a little Spaniſh Wine, and apply Aromatic Bags to the Belly. Beſides, as for the other Food of young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren it ought to conſiſt of white Bread dry'd and beaten ſmall, Yelks of Eggs and Aniſeed boil'd in Milk or Water to the Conſiſtence of a thin Pulp. That which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made of Flower and Milk or Water is fitter for Paſte
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:207638:318"/>than any thing elſe; for it lies heavy in the Child's Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac, and degenerats into a viſcous tough Crudity; whereas the Bread being already fermented, is ſooner and more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily digeſted. 'Tis cuſtomary among Nurſes to attenuate the Child's Food in their own Mouths before they give it; and indeed 'tis true that a healthy Nurſes Spittle is of uſe for promoting the quick Digeſtion: But if ſcorbutic Salts be lodg'd in her Gums, or if a Cacochymy prevail in her Body, it is too apt a Vehicle for conveying a morbifical Tincture into the Child's Body.</p>
               <p>Theſe premiſes, if duly weigh'd, will furniſh us with a diſtinct Idea of the Cauſes of Childrens Diſeaſes. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements retained and vicious Milk or Pap receiv'd into the Stomac, degenerat into an acid Crudity; which if impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd in a viſcid Vehicle, diſplays its force within, and if diluted with a thinner Serum, breaks out upon the Skin in various Eruptions. From this Source it were eaſy to derive all the particular Diſeaſes of Children, their violent Gripings, and voiding of diſcolor'd Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the generation of Wind and diſtention of the Belly; Vomiting and Inappetency; Hiccough, Watchings, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions; and the numberleſs Train of cuticular Eruptions, or aches on the Skin, occaſion'd partly by the Efflux of a ferous acid, and partly by a want of due tranſpiration which obliges it to ſtagnat in the out parts.</p>
               <p>Now foraſmuch as all theſe Diſeaſes of Children are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from one Cauſe, and conſequently demand the ſame Method of Cure, 'twill be needleſs to trace every diſtinct Symptom apart; and therefore we ſhall content our ſelves with a general Account of the Method of Cure. And indeed if the foregoing Hypotheſis be duly conſidered and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, 'twill be an obvious Conſequence that the Baſis of the Cure falls upon Alcalies, or ſuch Medicines as diſcuſs a viſcid Crudity, and imbibe an acid.</p>
               <p>Theſe are; firſt, the volatil Alkalies, eſpecially the Spirit of Sal Armoniac ſuccinat, which tho dreaded by ſome, is recommended by experience as an incomparable Medicine for Children. 'Tis given in the Mother's Milk, or in Mint or Fennel-water. To this Claſs we may join oily Aromatics, as Aniſeed given in Pouder to half a Dram; Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, Myrrh, and <hi>Elixir Proprietatis</hi> prepar'd without A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids. In the ſecond Rank we place the fix'd abſorbent Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calies, <hi>viz.</hi> Coral, Crabs-eyes, Pearl, Sea Horſe-teeth, Ivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Bezoar-ſtone. To which we may add the Tincture of
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:207638:319"/>Tartar, or that of the Droſs of the Regulus of Antimony; and <hi>Venice</hi> Triacle or Mithridate given to two Grains; (ſtronger Narcotics and more generous Medicines being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper.) As for example,</p>
               <p>Take of prepar'd Crabs-eyes half a Dram; Hartſhorn prepar'd without fire, half a Dram; prepar'd red Coral half a Scruple; choice Myrrh, ſix or nine Grains; <hi>Venice</hi> Triacle three or four Grains; diſtill'd Oil of Aniſe three or ſix Drops. Make a Pouder. Or,</p>
               <p>Take of Hartſhorn prepar'd without Fire a Scruple; Crabs-eyes and red Coral, of each half a Scruple; volatil Salt of Hartſhorn ſix Grains; <hi>Venice</hi> Triacle four Grains; choice Myrrh three Grains. Make a Pouder, of which give a convenient quantity in Milk or Pap.</p>
               <p>Take of Elder-flower-water two Ounces; Spirit of Sal Armoniac fifteen Drops; Hartſhorn prepar'd without Fire, the Jaw-bone of a Pike, and prepar'd Unicorn, of each half a Scruple; Syrup of Poppies two Drams. Make a Potion to be given by little Spoonfuls.</p>
               <p>Now the acid Crudity being thus ſubdu'd and prepar'd, it remains only to make Proviſion for its Evacuation, firſt by Clyſters of the Decoction of Chamomil-flowers, mix'd with Salt of Tartar, Hony of Rue, and Oil of Aniſe; or thoſe of Milk with Turpentin diſſolv'd by the Yelk of an Egg; or in a difficult Caſe, thus,</p>
               <p>Take of the Decoction of Carminative Ingredients with Salt of Tartar two Ounces; <hi>Sala</hi>'s Emetic Syrup two Drams; Hony of Roſes two Drams: Make a Clyſter.</p>
               <p>If a viſcid Slime ſtuff the Breaſt, we may exhibit for a Potion three Drams of Hyſſop Water, half a Dram of the Syrup of Tobacco, and a Scruple of <hi>Sala</hi>'s Emetic Syrup mix'd; or half an Ounce of Mint-water, with half a Dram of the Emetic Syrup. As for Purgatives take what follows,</p>
               <p>Take of the Solutive Syrup of Roſes two Drams; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd Crabs-eyes half a Dram; prepar'd red Coral twelve Grains: With a few Drops of the Spirit of Anis make a Mixture. Or,</p>
               <p>Take of the Pouder of Jalap ſix Grains; Tartar vitriolat half a Scruple. Make a Pouder.</p>
               <p>Manna given to two or four Drams in Breaſt-milk or Pap, is alſo a good Laxative. But above all, ſweet Mercury is the moſt effectual Correcter and Evacuater of acid viſcous Humours, eſpecially upon the approach of the Small Pox or Meaſles. 'Tis given at the rate of a Grain for every year of the Child's Age. As,</p>
               <pb n="637" facs="tcp:207638:319"/>
               <p>Take of the Pulp of Raiſins half a Dram; ſweet Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a Grain and a half; Pouder of Jalap three Grains. Make a Bolus.</p>
               <p>If Mercury be inſufficient, Fulminatory Gold given to a Grain with Ivory and Pouder of Sea-horſe-teeth, is a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Medicine; eſpecially if the firſt Paſſages be ſtuff'd. It operats more fiercely in wean'd Children than thoſe that ſuck, by reaſon that the Milk tempers it.</p>
               <p>Theſe Medicines, if diſcreetly manag'd, will anſwer all Diſeaſes in Children, particularly the gripings they are ſo liable to, which are attended by prodigious unquietneſs, and voiding of clotted or green Excrements, or at leaſt ſuch as are firſt yellow, and afterwards become green by reaſon of the freer Efferveſcence of the curdl'd Acid with the Bile. Theſe we cure by the above-mention'd Clyſters, (or thoſe of Milk when the yellow Excrements are thin and ſharp) and Mixtures of aromatic Waters, volatil Salts and fix'd Alkalies; and when all prove ineffectual, by exhibiting a Grain or two of <hi>Aurum Fulminans</hi> in black Cherry-water. Externally we anoint the Belly with diſtill'd Oils of Mace and Aniſe mix'd with the expreſs'd Oil of Nutmegs; or if the matter be very viſcous, with an Ointment made of Gum Ammoniac, Turpentin, Aloes, Hogs Tallow, freſh Butter, and diſtill'd Oil of Aniſe. If the Belly be diſtended by Wind, we exhibit the Pouder or diſtill'd Oil of Angelica-roots, Aniſeed, red Coral, and the Water of the Oak of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and anoint the Belly with Oil of Chamomil, and diſtill'd Oil of Aniſe. If the Child vomit often, 'tis a Sign of a ſtrong Stomac, and ought not to be ſtopt, eſpecially if it proceed only from a Redundancy of Milk; but if the Milk be corrupted and the matter diſcolour'd, we exhibit a Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der made of Nutmegs, Coral, and Cloves; or Cinnamom-water, and diſtill'd Oil of Cloves. Externally we inject Clyſters, and anoint the Belly and Stomac as above. Againſt the Hiccough vomiting is proper; as alſo Aniſeeds, <hi>Venice</hi> Triacle, and diſtill'd Oil of Cloves; or <hi>Joel</hi>'s Pouder of burnt Hartſhorn and red Coral. For Coſtiveneſs which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cauſes the Diſtention of the Belly, difficult Reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and many other bad Symptoms, we order 'em Mouſe-dung diſſolv'd in Milk, or in caſe of extremity Sweet Mercury and <hi>Aurum fulminans.</hi> Externally we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Clyſters of Rape and Linſeed Oils ſharpen'd with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of black Hellebor or Suppoſitories of <hi>Venice</hi> Soap; or apply to the Belly rotten Apples with Gooſe Fat, and
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:207638:320"/>Oil of Coloquintida; or in caſe of Extremity the Ointment of Sow-Bread mix'd with Bull's Gall, and Oil of Coloquinti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da. Ofttimes the ſtagnation of ſharp Sweat, or the neglect of ſhifting of the Child, galls the tender Skin under the Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits or about the Genitals; then we order the part to be firſt waſh'd with warm Water, and then ſprinkl'd with the Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitat of the Vitriol of Steel, mix'd with Chalk, Ceruſe, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar of Lead. Sometimes much crying or coughing will force the Caul or one of the Inteſtines into the Navel-ſtring, and ſo diſtend the Navel, and relax at the <hi>Peritonaeum;</hi> againſt which Inconvenience we exhibit Aniſeed inwardly, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint the Navel with Oil of Eggs, or Bear's Fat mix'd with the Seed of Thorowteaſel; and with a Roller faſten upon it a round Ball of Maſtic and red Wax, or Turpentin. If the Navel be inflam'd, we anoint with Oil of Roſes mix'd with Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſe and Sugar of Lead and apply the Plaiſter of <hi>Sperma Ceti.</hi> Sometimes crying, coughing, or much Wind in the Belly occaſions a Rupture, which we cure by applying a Plaiſter of the Skins of pickled Eels boil'd to a Conſiſtence in Lye, and bathing with aſtringent vulnerary Decoctions. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a watry Tumour diſtends the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> and feigns a Rupture; this is cur'd by fomenting with the Juice of Goat's Dung, and applying the Dung it ſelf as a Cataplaſm. A <hi>Teneſmus</hi> or Down-falling of the <hi>Anus</hi> is cur'd by Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migations of Pine-tree-Roſin, Sarcocolla, Bay-berries and Fennel-ſeeds, and applying Bags quilted with Mullein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers, Bran, Cummin-ſeeds, and Bay-berries. A Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Urine caus'd by a pituitous Humour in the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, is cur'd firſt by cleanſing the Body with Mechoacan and ſolutive Syrup of Roſes, and then exhibiting the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Vetches and Fennel-tops with ſome Drops of the Spirit of Turpentine, and Emulſions of Violet-ſeeds with the Water of Elder-flowers, or of Reſtharrow; and anointing the Pubes and <hi>Perinaeum</hi> with Oil of Scorpions and that of Wax, or applying Cataplaſms of Chamomil, roſted Onyons, and Oil of Scorpions. An Incontinence of Urine is removed by fomenting the Sphincter of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with aſtringent Decoctions, and giving inwardly Caſtor, Myrrh, and Oxymel.</p>
               <p>The Thruſh or Wheals that frequently beſet Childrens Tongues, Throat and Stomac (and ſometimes the Guts, as appears by ſcaly Excrements) are cur'd by waſhing 'em with Speedwel-water, and Juice of Turneps; or applying a Liniment of the Mucilage of Quinces extracted with the
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:207638:320"/>Water of Frogs Spawn, mix'd with Juice of Houſeleek and Allum; or Hony of Roſes mix'd with Spirit of Salt. If the Gums be putrify'd, gargle the Mouth with the Decoction of Chervil and Sage in Water mix'd with Hony and a little Vinegar.</p>
               <p>Stubborn Watchings are frequently the Harbingers of an Epilepſy, and therefore ought to be obviated betimes by exhibiting gentle Laxatives, and Emulſions of Sweet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds with abſorbent Pouders. Perhaps <hi>Venice</hi> Triacle or Mithridate, and the Rinds of Poppy-heads boil'd in Milk are not amiſs; but the Preparations from Poppies are to be cautiouſly us'd if the Children be very young. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally we bathe the Temples with the Nurſe's Milk mix'd with Saffron; and anoint the Breaſt and Pit of the Neck with an Ointment of expreſs'd Oil of Nutmegs, and the diſtill'd Oils of Rue and Amber. An Epilepſy is alſo uſher'd in by a ſtarting and frights in ſleep, occaſion'd by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Excurſion of the Spirits, which requires the ſame Cure as an Epilepſy. Now an Epilepſy for the moſt part ſeems to proceed from a provoking Acid in the Guts, and is cur'd by Alkalin Abſorbent Pouders; ſuch as Cinnabar of Antimony, Unicorn's Horn, Cryſtal, Sea-horſe-tooth, and eſpecially Amber and Miſletoe of Hazel-wood, and the Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Moſs call'd <hi>Wood Claw.</hi> If theſe be inſufficent, we add to them the volatil Salt of Amber, or which is yet better, the Spirit of Hartſhorn impregnated with Amber. But above all, the Sulphur of Antimony or Fulminatory Gold (each of 'em given to a Grain) are the moſt effectual Medicines.</p>
               <p>Convulſions are frequently caus'd by the breeding of Teeth, eſpecially the ſharp Eye-teeth; whoſe original ſoft Pulp, being harden'd about the ſixth or ſeventh Month, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to force its Paſſage through the Gums, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly irritates the nervous Syſtem, contracts the ſalivating Glandules, and occaſions that obſervable Heat and Efflux of Serum to the Mouth, and the Inflammation of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Parts. This Symptom is cur'd by keeping the Belly open, and applying to the Gums the Mucilages of Flea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort and Quince-ſeeds, extracted with the Water of Frogs Spawn, mix'd with Oil of Sweet Almonds and that of Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies; or the Brains of a Hare boil'd to the Conſiſtence of a Liniment with Hony. Some recommend the Blood of a Cock's Comb for the ſame uſe. Externally we anoint the Cheeks with emollient and diſcuſſive Oils. If the ſwelling of the Gums begin to appear white in the middle, it may
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:207638:321"/>be cut with a Knife, to make way for the Tooth. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Children are troubled with Swellings upon the Gums, that are not caus'd by Teeth, and then they cry, if the Region of their Ears be touch'd. This Symptom is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd by anointing the Swellings with the Oil of Sweet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, and the Region of the Ears with the fat of Hares.</p>
               <p>A Looſeneſs is frequently caus'd by the defect of <hi>Saliva</hi> following the breeding of Teeth, as alſo by the thinneſs or watryneſs of the Nurſe's Milk. It ought not to be ſtop'd at firſt; but if it laſt above ſix days, or if the Excrements be ſharp, green, or black, and the Appetit dejected, a ſpeedy Cure muſt be indeavour'd by abſorbent Pouders, and the common Specifics againſt a Looſeneſs.</p>
               <p>Worms in the Guts are frequently the Authors of the Epilepſy, Feaver, Unquietneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that moleſt Children. They are diſcover'd by theſe Symptoms. The Child's Mouth is always full of <hi>Saliva,</hi> eſpecially in a Morning, while the Stomac is empty; it rubs its Noſe and gnaſhes with its Teeth while aſleep. Its appetite is uncertain, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times voracious, tho follow'd by leanneſs; and ſometimes very low; the Belly ſometimes ſinks, and ſometimes is much inlarged. The Face is liable to frequent Fluſhings, and Alterations of Colour; the Belly is for the moſt part open and much grip'd. The Seeds of theſe Worms are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd into the Body in the Child's Food, eſpecially in Corn or Bread. Sweet Mercury and the Conſerve of Peach-flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, interlac'd with the bitter Specifics, abſorbent Pouders and volatil Alkalies compaſs the Cure. Sometimes a Worm ſettles its ſelf within the Navel-ſtring, and cauſes a paleneſs of the Lips, waſting of the Body, and unquietneſs; 'tis kill'd by applying to the Belly the inner Shell of a Walnut fill'd with the Pouder of <hi>Venice</hi> Glaſs, and that of Saffron; and then it ought to be purg'd out.</p>
               <p>Children are frequently troubled with a Cough which proceeds for the moſt part from the Stomac. If it be a wet Cough, Vomits are abſolutely neceſſary. If dry, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Hartſhorn ſuccinat, the Spirit of Sal Armoniac, <hi>Sperma Ceti,</hi> the Mucilage of Linſeed, Figgs ſoak'd in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine, the Juice of Rapes, and Pulp of Raiſins join'd to gentle Anodynes are noted Specifics. If the Cough be convulſive, we exhibit the Caſtor and Spirit of Amber. If the matter be very thick, the Juice of Horſe-Radiſhes, or of Fennel, the Syrup of Hyſſop or that of Tobacco, and <hi>Sala</hi>'s Emetic Syrup are very proper. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:207638:321"/>in a dry Cough we waſh the Child's Feet in hot Ale, and anoint 'em with the Goats Tallow. If a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful defluction attend the Cough, we cover the Head with Cotton fumigated with Amber, Frankincenſe, and the Gum of the Juniper-tree. If the Child's Noſe is ſtop'd, put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it a Clout wet with Marjoram and black Cherry-water impregnated with white Vitriol, and anoint the Noſtrils with the Oil of ſweet Almonds mix'd with a few drops of the Oil of Marjoram.</p>
               <p>The Acidity of the Lymph, caus'd by the Crudities in the Stomac, frequently occaſions an Obſtruction and ſwelling of the Glandules about the Ears, Neck and Head; and a milky Cruſt or ſcaly Eruption in the Head and Face, which in proceſs of time, if the Acid be very ſharp, degenerats into Ulcers voiding corrupt matter. If this Eruption be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably ſuppreſs'd, it occaſions a Cough, Looſeneſs, Convulſions, and many other bad Symptoms. For Cure; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally we exhibit Purgatives, eſpecially ſweet Mercury; and abſorbent Pouders, together with volatil Spirits. Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally we anoint the cruſty Eruptions with Oil of Tartar <hi>per Deliquium</hi> and Camphyr, and bathe 'em with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Dock-roots, Marſhmallows, Soap-wort and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landine in ſmall Beer or Child's Urine; and cover the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Ulcers with the Pouder of the Precipitat from Vitriol of Steel, mix'd with Calaminar Stone, Chalk, Ceruſs, Salt of Tartar and Myrrh; and apply diſcuſſive Plaiſters to the ſwell'd Glandules. When the Evil is inveterat, and the Ulcers are become fetid, 'tis cuſtomary to waſh 'em with the Decoction of Tobacco, and mix Quick-ſilver with the Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or order a Girdle of Quick-ſilver kill'd with Hog's Fat: But theſe Applications are not always ſafe. <hi>Pana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollus</hi>'s Ointment of Sulphur, Juice of Lemons and Hog's Fat; or that of the Yelks of Eggs boil'd hard with Myrrh, black Hellebor, Cuckou-pint, and Snake-weed-roots, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable. If the Skull be corroded by the Ulcers, we apply Hony of Roſes mix'd with Spirit of Wine; and the Pouder of Birthwort mix'd with Balſam of Peru. If the Child's Head be louſy, apply the Oil of Spike and Pouder of Stave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre over night, or the Juice of Wormwood mix'd with Quick-ſilver; or, which is yet ſafer, the precipitat of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury prepar'd with Spirit of Nitre; waſhing it next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a Lee of the Decoction of Lavender and Spike.</p>
               <p>This Acidity of the Lymph, proceding from curdled Milk in the Stomac, is alſo the Cauſe of the ſmall Pox
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:207638:322"/>and Meaſles. They are uſher'd in by a dry Cough, a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trineſs and ſwelling of the Eyes, and itching of the Noſe. So ſoon as we can diſcover their approach, we exhibit ſweet Mercury with a Grain of the Pouder of Jalap; or if the ſtrength be much impair'd, and the Heat be violent, the Sulphur of Antimony precipitated from the Droſs of the Regulus. If the Belly be ſwoln and infeſted with Noiſe, we inject gentle Clyſters. After the Ebullition is over, we adminiſter the Emulſions of the out-ſtriking Seeds with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, Myrrh, Diaphoretic Antimony, Cinnabar of Antimony, fix'd Salts, abſorbent Pouders; and the Juice of Horſe-Dung. If the Malignity of the Humours cauſe Convulſions, we add the volatil Salt of Amber, and the ſuccinat Spirit of Hartſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn. If the Child be very reſtleſs, we may venture to give a ſmall quantity of the Syrup of Poppies. If a Vomiting attend the beginning of the Diſeaſe, we ought not to ſtop it, unleſs it prove exceſſive, and then we give <hi>Venice</hi> Tria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and <hi>Laudanum Opiatum;</hi> or rather the Spirit of Hartſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn Succinat. To prevent a Looſeneſs, which in this caſe is fatal, let the Nurſe and Child both drink the Decoction of Vipergraſs with the Gelly of Hartſhorn. As for the other Symptoms that generally accompany this Diſeaſe, ſee the firſt Book.</p>
               <p>Ofttimes the Child is emaciated, and does not thrive, and that chiefly upon three accounts. 1. When the Nurſe's Milk is ſtale and ſharp. In this Caſe we change the Nurſe, and bathe the Child in Goats Milk, and exhibit the Water di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd from Ivy, or that from Fern. 2. When Worms exhauſt the nutritious Juice. Beſides thoſe in the Guts treated of already, there are others like little Hairs that not only exhauſt the nouriſhment, but continually gall and gnaw the skin. They are cur'd thus: Bathe the Child in warm Water or Lee, in which Chickens Dung is boil'd, and rub the Body over with Hony to tempt the Worms to come out in the form of black Hairs. Then ſcrape 'em off with a Cruſt of Bread made ſharp like the Edg of a Knife. After this has been practis'd three or four times, bathe 'em in Wormwood-water in which Aloe is diſſolv'd, or in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Quickſilver. Inwardly the Tinctures of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, Eſſence of Myrrh, and Salt of Vipers are proper. 3. When the Glandules of the Meſentery, or milky Veſſels, are ſtuff'd with viſcid Crudities, and deny paſſage to the Chyle. This we diſcover by the hardneſs and diſtention
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:207638:322"/>of the Belly, the viſcidity and whiteneſs of Excrements; and cure it by the abovemention'd volatil attenuating Ingredients. To which we may add the Tinctures of Steel, the Tincture and Salt of Tartar, and after the Child is wean'd, <hi>Arcanum Duplicatum.</hi> Externally we anoint the Belly with the Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Soubread, and that of Marſhmallows, Gum Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac and Oil of Chamomil.</p>
               <p>The Fevers that Children are liable to, are alſo owing to the corrupt Crudities in the firſt Paſſages, which defile the Blood. Their Cure is perform'd by anſwering the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Indications according as the infirmity of Children will admit, and the nature of the Fever requires. In general, Laxatives and abſorbent Pouders accompliſh the Deſign.</p>

But 'tis not neceſſary for a Phyſician to be nicely acquainted with all the particular Directions for the Hand, that being a Province peculiar to Surgeons: So that our preſent buſineſs amounts no further than to account for a Phyſician's Duty in regulating the Method of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Applications and inward Adminiſtrations.

The former are frequently injur'd by applying oily fat things which injoy a latent Acidity prejudicial to the Bones. The latter are either ſanguine or ſpermatic.

                  <p>A Swelling is the Enlargement of the Dimenſions of any part. It may be caus'd by Diſlocation or Wind; but for the moſt it owes its being to Humours; as, if the Blood or Serum ſtagnate; the former Cauſes Inflammations, the latter ſoft white Swellings: If the thinner Humours force their Paſſage, while thick viſcous Excrements ſtick by the way, they gather into a Body by degrees, and ſo cauſe Tumours, ſuch as the critical Swellings that ſucceed to Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, to the Plague, and French Pox, and the hard Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of Glandules. If the nutritious Humour of any part is corrupted by a vitious Ferment reſiding in it, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe occaſionally alter'd, it degenerats into Impoſthumes, Ulcers, Callous Tumours and Excreſcences. And if the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritive Juice be too plentifully receiv'd into any part, it produces the like effects.</p>
                  <p>The remote Cauſes are the ſtraitneſs of the Paſſages occaſion'd by Conſtriction, Compreſſion, or painful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions of the Fibres; the viſcidity and thickneſs of the Humour; the diſproportion of its Particles; the Influence of an acid Ferment; the extraordinary diſtention of the Pores giving entrance to large Quantities of nutritious Juice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Swellings are cur'd by retrieving the natural Motion of the ſtagnating Humours; or by Diſcuſſion, Suppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or artificial opening. Diſcuſſion is proper for ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine Tumours, and is accompliſh'd by applying volatil at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuating Ingredients, which temper the congealing Acid, and diſſipat or exhale the Humour. Suppuration is the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of a mutual Efferveſcence betwixt the alkalin oily parts, and the Acid which precipitats 'em into a white Pus; but
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:207638:324"/>if the Acid be predominant, the Tumour either degenerats into a Schirrus, or breaks the Skin without Suppuration. Upon which account all ripening Ingredients ought to be juicy and balm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, for tempering the Acid, and unbending the Fibres of the part. Hence volatil Remedies which diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the thin and ſo condenſate the thick Humours, and thoſe of an acid quality, are improper. Indeed if nature be inactive, and the Humour be very thick, 'twill ſometimes be uſeful to join ſome ſharper Ingredients to the ordinary Medicines. If the Swelling cannot be forc'd to Suppuration, it ought to be open'd by a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Then beat the Pulp thro a Sieve, and add to it of Horſe-dung three Ounces; Oil of Chamomil an Ounce and a half; roſted Onyons two Ounces. Make a Cataplaſm. Common Soap diſſolv'd in hot Milk is alſo very proper.</p>

                  <p>The diſcuſſive Ingredients are endow'd with volatil ſubtil hot parts, for ſubduing the Acid, melting down the thicken'd Humour, and opening the Pores.

                  <p>The general Doctrine of Tumours being thus premis'd, we proceed to the Deſcription of particular Swellings, which we caſt into four Heads. 1. Thoſe that proceed from the Stagnation of Blood. 2. Such as are Critical. 3. Such as ariſe from the Depravation of the Lymph; and 4. Thoſe which relate to the Blood-Veſſels.</p>

                     <pb n="648" facs="tcp:207638:325"/>1. Under the firſt Head we comprehend Inflammations, Blood-ſhot and St. <hi>Antony</hi>'s Fire. Inflammations are cur'd thus: Inwardly we exhibit the ſame Medicines as we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd for a Pleuriſy; to which we add Nitre, by reaſon of the Feaver that accompanies 'em. Externally we firſt bleed; and then endeavour to diſcuſs 'em by applying the Decoction of Sulphur in Urine, and the Plaiſter of <hi>Sperma Ceti,</hi> or the Juice of River-Crabs and Horſe-dung; or the Spirit of Wine camphoriz'd, mix'd with gentle Diaphoretics, and the Water of <hi>Spirma Ceti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If theſe do not ſucceed, we muſt endeavour to bring the Swelling to a head, by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Milk, in which Caſtle-ſoap is boil'd. But if the Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and Heat be great, we muſt avoid oily fat Ingredients. If the Inflammation be ſpurious, that is, if a pituitous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour accompany the ſtagnating Blood, we may add Ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the ſharper kind. Generally the Plaiſters of Melilot and Diachylon, ſofter'd with the Oil of Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ies, or Ointment of ſweet Almonds, are very proper. After the Swelling is open, apply the Balſam of Sulphur and Plaiſter <hi>Diaſulphuris,</hi> or an Ointment of Turpentin, Hony of Roſes, and Balſam of Peru diſſolv'd in the Yelk of an Egg. If the Ulcers are deep and hollow, inject the Decoction of Tobacco and Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, mix'd with Myrrh and Aloes, or temper'd with Lime-water and the Spirit of <hi>Venice</hi> Triacle. Some are wont to apply Aſtringent Cataplaſms and Plaiſters in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of an Inflammation, in order, as they fancy to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the irruption of the Blood; but the Rules of Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation have diſcover'd their Miſtake.</p>
                  <p>Blood-ſhot is the effect of Contuſions, or the Diſtortion of the Capillary Veſſels. Its internal Cure is the ſame as that of a Pleuriſy. Externally we apply a ſlice of raw Beef; or <hi>Venice</hi> Triacle mix'd with the Syrup of Elder, Sugar of Lead, and Salt of Wormwood. If theſe prove ſucceſsleſs, we muſt have recourſe to Cataplaſms of the Roots of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Seal and Comfry, bruis'd and boil'd in Wine; or to the Spirit of Wine camphoris'd and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Sal Armoniac. If a nervous part be affected by the Contuſion, we exhibit the Oil of Lavender inwardly, and anoint the part with the Balſam of Peru mix'd with Spirit of Wine and Oil of Caſtor. If the Symptom do not diſappear after theſe Applications, we muſt endeavour to ſuppurat, and after Suppuration conſolidate as above. But when the
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:207638:325"/>Part quickly becomes black, and threatens a Gangrene, or when the Contuſion is deep and reaches beyond the Cuticle, 'tis not ſafe to ſtay for Maturation; therefore we ſcarify it, and then apply Aromatic Decoctions, or Lime-water ſharpen'd with the Spirit of Wine and ſweet Mercury.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Antony</hi>'s Fire is an Inflammation incident to Scorbuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Perſons, and ſeems to proceed from a ſubtil volatil Acid, that ferments with the volatil Salt of the Blood, and cauſes it to ſtagnat. It is uſher'd in by ſhivering, and attended by a notable Heat and Feaver. Its Colour is very red; when touch'd it becomes white, but quickly reaſſumes its redneſs; It ſpreads over the neighbouring Parts, and is apt to dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat into ſordid Ulcers or Gangrenes. When it beſets the Arms, 'tis more troubleſome than in the Legs: If it ſtrike in, or ſeize the Head, Face, Mouth, or Fundament, 'tis very dangerous. Its internal Cure is accompliſh'd by the Water, Eſſence, and Syrup of Elder-flowers, mix'd with the volatil Salt of Hartſhorn, or that of Amber, Camphyr, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar of Lead, Diaphoretic Antimony, Cinnabar of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and abſorbent Pouders. Purgation before the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſion is abſolutely pernicious; as alſo bleeding, unleſs the Diſeaſe be occaſion'd by a Contuſion, Fracture or Wound. Externally cold, aſtringent, oily and fat Ingredients are hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; the more proper Medicines are the Decoctions of Elder-flowers in which <hi>Venice</hi> Triacle and Caſtle-ſoap are diſſolv'd; the Spirit of Wine impregnated with Camphyr or Saffron; the Decoction of Myrrh, and Frankincenſe in Wine, mix'd with Camphyr and Saffron; the Water of <hi>Sperma Ceti,</hi> and that of Cow's Dung diſtill'd in May; the bruis'd Leaves of Radiſhes applyed as Cataplaſms; Clouts dip'd in Hare's Blood, or the firſt Flood of a Virgin's Terms; the Leaves of Arſemart bruis'd and applied; the Pouders of Myrrh, Frankincenſe, Chalk, Sugar of Lead and Camphyr, ſprinkl'd upon brown Paper dip'd into the Spirit of Wine impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with Saffron. To all which we may add <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> as occaſion requires. The following Ointment is alſo much approv'd.</p>
                  <p>Take of the Pouder of Elder-flowers three Drams; Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſs a Dram and a half: With Salt of Wormwood, and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> Triacle make an Ointment. The Ointment of Sugar of Lead and Syrup of Elder, is likewiſe of noted Efficacy.</p>
                  <p>If notwithſtanding theſe Precautions, the Swelling be ulcerated, apply the Water of Quick-lime prepar'd with Elder flowers, and mix'd with the Juice of Creſſes, Sugar of Lead and Ceruſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="650" facs="tcp:207638:326"/>2. Under the Second Head, <hi>viz.</hi> Critical Swellings, we comprehend <hi>Buboes,</hi> Swellings of the Glandules behind the Ears, the fiery Botches call'd Carbuncles; thoſe call'd <hi>Furun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi, Phymata,</hi> and <hi>Phygilta;</hi> the Swellings in the Fingers call'd <hi>Paronychia,</hi> and Chilblains in the Hands and Feet.</p>
                  <p>A Bubo is a Swelling in the Groin or Armpits. If it lie deep, low, and flat, 'tis very dangerous. If it accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny peſtilential Feavers, we ought to promote its Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, by avoiding Purgation and Bleeding; exhibiting Sudorifics; and applying externally Cataplaſms of the Juice of Celandine, mix'd with <hi>Venice</hi> Triacle, Soot, and roaſted Onyons and Garlic; or Toads dry'd and ſoak'd in Wine. If the Skin be thick and the Swelling obſtinat, we apply a bliſtering Plaiſter, and when the Bliſter is open, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>'s <hi>Magnes Arſenicalis,</hi> which will extract the Malignity in the form of a Cruſt. After this Cruſt is remov'd, we cleanſe the Ulcer with a Mixture of the Balſam of Sulphur, Ointment, Baſilicon and <hi>Venice</hi> Triacle. Venereal Bubo's are accounted for above.</p>
                  <p>The Critical Swellings behind the Ears ought to be brought to a Head when they accompany malignant Feavers, by ripening Cataplaſms and Plaiſters. To which, if the Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings are very hard, we add Gum Ammoniac diſſolv'd in Vinegar, and the ſtinking Oils of Guajacum and Tartar. When the Swelling is ripe, it ought to be open'd and cleans'd.</p>
                  <p>Carbuncles are very malignant Swellings, caus'd by a ſharp, cauſtic, lixivious Salt ſeparated from the Blood, which creates a bitter Heat and Pain, mortifies and blackens the Part, and occaſions a cruſty Ulcer, like thoſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Application of potential Cauteries. This Ulcer is ſometimes uſher'd in by little whitiſh or livid Puſhes; and is always ſurrounded with a red or livid Circle, according as the adjacent parts are more or leſs mortified. 'Tis cur'd thus: Apply the Butter of Antimony to the middle of the Ulcer, and make a Circle with it about the mortified part: So the corrupt part will fall off, and the further Progreſs of the Mortification be prevented. In the room of the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Antimony, ſome chooſe to apply <hi>Sala</hi>'s <hi>Magnes Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenicalis,</hi> the Part being firſt prepar'd by a bliſtering Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. <hi>Valeriola</hi> orders it to be ſcarify'd, and then he applies the following Cataplaſm.</p>
                  <p>Take of the Juices of Comfry, Scabious and Marygold, of each an Ounce; <hi>Venice</hi> Triacle three Drams; common
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:207638:326"/>Salt a Dram, and two Yelks of Eggs. Mix for a Cataplaſm: which ſeparats the Cruſt, and prepares the Ulcer for being cleans'd firſt by <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Aegyptiacum,</hi> then by the Oil of Eggs, the Balſam of Sulphur, and the Plaiſter <hi>Diachylon</hi> with Gums. In the mean while we adminiſter internally Antimonial Sudorifics mix'd with Acids.</p>
                  <p>The Swellings call'd <hi>Furunculi</hi> are the red, hot, pointed Botches appearing in glandulous parts. They are cur'd by promoting Suppuration, and avoiding Repellents; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thoſe call'd <hi>Phymata,</hi> which are round glandulous Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, flat in the lower part, and pointed like a Plant in the upper. Thoſe ſtyl'd <hi>Phygeltons</hi> are hard glandulous Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings reſembling a Muſhroom adhering to a Tree. They are cur'd by applying diſcuſſing Medicines mix'd with ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and anodyn Ingredients.</p>
                  <p>The Swelling call'd <hi>Paronychia</hi> is a painful Tumor of the Joints of the Fingers, ſometimes fix'd, ſometimes wandring from one Joint to another. The Cauſe is a ſharp corroſive Humour collected about the roots of the Nails, where it gnaws the <hi>Perioſtium</hi> and Tendons, and ſo cauſes Inflammations, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſthums, and ſometimes Gangrenes. For Cure, we admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter Mercurial Purges, and apply the Spirit of Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms, Balſam of Sulphur and the Plaiſter <hi>Diachylon;</hi> or a Liniment of Earwax, Sugar of Lead, and the expreſs'd Oil of Filberts. Some order the Finger to be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a new-laid Egg while 'tis hot, or into a Dunghil, and held ſo for ſome time. Sometimes 'tis neceſſary to lay the Swelling open, and then apply to it <hi>Venice</hi> Triacle diſſolv'd in Wine. And for a defenſive to the whole Hand, a Liniment of the Ointments <hi>Populeum</hi> and <hi>Album Camphoratum</hi> mix'd with Opium and <hi>Venice</hi> Triacle.</p>
                  <p>The Chilblains or Kibes are whitiſh Swellings in the Hands and Feet, apt to become blewiſh, and ſometimes to ulcerat. They are generally occaſion'd by Cold, and are cur'd or prevented by applying Rock-Oil, or the diſtill'd Oil of the Pine-tree, or the diſtill'd Oil of Turpentine mix'd with the expreſs'd Oil of Rapes. Some order the part to be rub'd Morning and Evening with Ice or cold Snow, and to be waſh'd with the Decoction of frozen Rapes; or with the Spirit of Wine camphoris'd, or impregnated with Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries or Saffron. If the parts are much injur'd, we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Cataplaſms of Yeſt, diſtill'd Vinegar, and Sulphur of Antimony. If the Kibes are ulcerated, we apply a Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment expreſs'd from a Rape, excavated and fill'd with the
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:207638:327"/>Oil of St. <hi>John</hi>'s-wort, and ſo roaſted; or ſprinkle 'em with the Pouder of Man's Dung, and then anoint 'em with an Ointment of freſh Juniper-berries and boil'd Butter; or of the Mucilage of Quinces, extracted with Nightſhade-water, and mix'd with prepar'd Tutty.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Tumours next in order are ſuch as proceed from the Diſorders of the Lymph. Such are the ſerous, watry, ſoft, painleſs Swellings, that receive no impreſſion by the preſſure of one's Finger, and if look'd upon ſideways, ſeem to be pellucid. They proceed from the Obſtruction of the Lymph, and are cur'd internally by adminiſtring Diuretics, and the Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſudorific Woods; externally by applying Lime-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter impregnated with Spirit of Wine, and Cataplaſms of Cow's Dung, Cumin-ſeeds and Lye; or the Plaiſter of Bay-berries mix'd with Goat's Dung and Hony.</p>
                  <p>If the Lymph be viſcid, it occaſions a ſoft, white, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Swelling that retains Pits by the preſſure of one's Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and is call'd an <hi>Oedema,</hi> which generally accompanies Chronical Diſtempers: For the internal Cure we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe ſtomachical and aromatic Medicines, and whatever corrects the Crudities of the Chyle, that are juſtly account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Cauſes of viſcid Lymph. Externally we apply Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſives, for 'tis in vain to attempt Suppuration. As,</p>
                  <p>Take of the Leaves of Tamarisk, Roſemary and Rue, of each a handful: boil them in Wine till they become ſoft; then add of the Meal of Vetches and Bran, of each three Ounces; Cow's Dung four Ounces; Duck's Fat an Ounce and a half; Hony four Ounces. Make a Cataplaſm. If <hi>Oedema's</hi> happen in the declenſions of Feavers, Cataplaſms of the Herb <hi>Robert</hi> or of Celandin bruisd with Wormwood are very proper. Some fumigate the Parts with Amber and Vinegar upon red hot ſtones, and apply the Plaiſter of Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries mix'd with diſtill'd Oil of Amber, renewing it twice a day. Roſemary-leaves and Juniper berries boild in Lye for a waſh for the Feet, or Bay-berries boil'd in Lime-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the Lee of Vine-twigs to be apply'd with a Spunge, are much approv'd. If the Swelling be hard, a Cataplaſm of Goats Dung and Man's Urine is very proper.</p>
                  <p>If the viſcid Lymph be fix'd by an Acid, and ſtagnat in glandulous parts, it creats ſcrophulous Swellings call'd the King's Evil, ſome of which are hard, ſome ſoft, ſome looſe and moveable, others immoveable; ſome painleſs, and others very painful and ſhooting, as being near akin to Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. Theſe Tumours we endeavour to diſcuſs by applying
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:207638:327"/>Cataplaſms of the Leaves and Roots of wild Cucumbers with Goat's-Dung, and the Plaiſter <hi>de Ranis</hi> with Mercury; or Gum Caran mixt with Mercury and Turpentin; and anointing with <hi>Helmont</hi>'s diſtill'd Oil. In their Infancy the Fat of Vipers is alſo very proper. If they cannot be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs'd, we muſt endeavour to bring 'em to maturity by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the Plaiſter of Melilot mix'd with the Oil of ſweet Almonds and Fat of Snakes; or <hi>Platerus</hi>'s Plaiſter of Tobacco, or <hi>Sala</hi>'s Magnetic Plaiſter mix'd with <hi>Diaſulphuris.</hi> When they are ripe, we ought not to open 'em, but leave 'em to their natural leiſure, that ſo the better part of the Glandule may be diſſolv'd into <hi>Pus.</hi> After they're broke, we apply the common Digeſtives mix'd with precipitat Mercury well waſh'd. If the Swellings are looſe and pendulous, we tie 'em with a Horſe-hair, and ſo by degrees force their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. If they're inclos'd in proper Tunicles, 'twill be needful to extirpate the whole Membrane by the hand of a Surgeon.</p>
                  <p>The internal Cure of the King's Evil is compaſs'd by purging with ſweet Mercury, and black Hellebor, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring the Decoction of Swallow-wort, Pile-wort, Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort and Broom, or the following abſorbent Pouder. Take of burnt Sea-ſpunge three Ounces; Bone of the Cuttle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh, Jaw bone of a Pike, prepar'd Crabs-eyes, long Peper, white Ginger, Roots of Pellitory of <hi>Spain,</hi> Galls, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin'd Egg-ſhells, of each an Ounce. Make a Pouder. Doſe half a Dram to be given with a convenient quantity of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canum Duplicatum.</hi> The Pouder of Lizards with Hony in the Form of an Electuary is alſo of excellent uſe.</p>
                  <p>Next to the Kings Evil are Schirrus's which are hard, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable Tumors in ſoft fleſhy parts, both internal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal. They proceed from the Coagulation of Blood, as when they follow Inflammations, or from the ſtagnation of crude Chyle, either in company with the Blood or in any other Vehicle. For the moſt part theſe Tumours are free of Pain: if they happen to be very painful and livid, they are of a ſpurious race, and apt to degenerat into Cancers. For Cure, we endeavour to diſcuſs a Schirrus by applying Cow's Dung boil'd in Vinegar, or the ſtinking Oil of Tartar, and that of Earthworms mix'd with Spirit of Wine; or Cataplaſms of Briony-roots, Goats-Dung, Lye and Soap. If theſe be inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, we muſt have recourſe to the Gums, eſpecially Gum Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac and the Plaiſter of Hemlock with Mercury, or a Plate of Lead applied to the part. If the Tumour cannot be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs'd,
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:207638:328"/>we muſt bring it to a Head with ripening Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; but withal take care that they be not too violent, leſt it degenerat into a Cancer.</p>
                  <p>A Cancer for the moſt part is the Conſequent of ſchirrous and ſcrophulous Tumours, and frequently invades the Breaſts and glandulous places. If it come by it ſelf, it appears firſt as a Tumour no bigger than a Bean, and by degrees increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, becomes hard, black, livid, and moleſted with ſhooting pains. Afterwards it feſters, ſtinks, and corrodes the adjacent parts, being ſurrounded with Veins ſwoln with black Blood. The immediat Cauſe is a volatil corroſive Acid, which if it be not ſupplied with freſh Recruits may lie hid in the part a long time before it feſter, and then we call it an occult Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. But as ſoon as it becomes an Ulcer, 'tis juſtly intitl'd a manifeſt one. If a Cancer proceed from internal Cauſes: If the whole Maſs of Blood, and the Bowels are tainted: If the Tumour lie very deep or near to large Veſſels: If the pain be violent, and frequent Bleedings enſue, 'tis a dangerous caſe. If a Cancer be occult, it ought not to be tamper'd with, nor is it ſafe to apply any thing except ſome very temperat Alcalies; ſuch as the Juice of Nightſhade bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in a leaden Mortar, the Juice of the Prick-thiſtle call'd <hi>Onophordon,</hi> the Pulp of rotten Apples, or Quick-lime-water prepar'd with the Water of rotten Apples, the Juice of River-Crabs and Man's Dung. Sugar of Lead, and all Preparations from Lead are of excellent uſe; eſpecially a Plate of Lead cover'd with Quick-ſilver. Ointments and Cerecloths of burnt Lead, mix'd with the Oil of Roſes, Oil of Frogs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are alſo recommended; but all oily things ought to be cautiouſly us'd. In the mean while 'twill be proper to exhibit internally abſorbent Anti-acid Pouders follow'd by Purges of black Hellebor and ſweet Mercury. After which the Sugar of Lead, the Tincture of Antimony tartaris'd, the volatil Spirit of Tartar, the Decoction of River-Crabs in Milk; and above all, the Pouder of Wood-lice mix'd with Crabs-eyes, are us'd with notable ſucceſs: ſometimes Iſſues are uſeful. As for manifeſt Cancers, we ſhall have occaſion to take notice of 'em afterwards under the Head of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Acidity of the Lymph ſtands alſo charg'd, as being the Cauſe of the Gummy Tumors that grow upon the Bones in the French Pox: For 'tis the vicious Acid that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts the natural Nouriſhment of the Bones, and occaſions its degeneracy into a preternatural Swelling. They are cur'd internally by the ſudorific Decoctions, or by a Saliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:207638:328"/>with Mercury interlac'd with Preparations of Steel and Vipers. Externally we apply the diſſolving Gums, with the diſtill'd Oil of Guajacum and Mercury, or a Plate of Lead cover'd with Quick-ſilver, or Quick-ſilver congeal'd by the Fumes of Lead. For mitigating the pain we may add Opium to all ſuch Compoſitions.</p>
                  <p>The occaſional Depravation of the nouriſhment of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of the Body will alſo cauſe ſeveral ſorts of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. As upon broken Bones a <hi>Callus;</hi> upon tendonous places a <hi>Ganglion,</hi> and upon fleſhy parts fleſhy <hi>Excreſcences.</hi> The firſt two are diſcuſs'd by applying a Plate of Lead with Mercury, or the ſtinking Oil of Tartar with Caſtle-Soap, or the Spirit of Wine with the Juice of Rue; or in obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat Caſes, the Plaiſter <hi>de Ranis</hi> with Mercury. Fleſhy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcences, unleſs they adhere to the Nerves or Arteries, ought to be cut off, and the Root eaten away by the Butter of Antimony and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Aegyptiacum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some Excreſcences are incloſed within their own proper Membrans, and contain peculiar Humors, ſometimes like Hony, ſometimes like Pap, and in other Caſes like Soap or Fat. The Cauſe of ſuch Excreſcences is the diſtortion and enlargement of the Fibres, occaſioning a large acceſſion of Juice which diſtends and adds to the Growth of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plac'd Fibres, till by ſhooting out new Tendrels, they join one another in the Form of a Concave Membrane, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the ſtagnating Juice variouſly alter'd according to the different occaſions. They frequently happen about the Head and Neck, and ſhare the common Fate of ſome nervous Swellings, in being liable to alterations from the Moon. For Cure; if they are recent, we may attempt to diſcuſs 'em with Gum Ammoniac, Balſam of Peru, Sulphur, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If they cannot be diſcuſs'd, we ply 'em with ſharp ſuppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating Ingredients; ſuch as Gum Ammoniac, Pellitory of <hi>Spain,</hi> Euphorbium, and Oil of Amber. When the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are thus ripen'd, we open 'em with a Launce, and apply a Cauſtic of the Ointment <hi>Aegyptiacum,</hi> the dulcify'd Earth of Vitriol and Salt, for extirpating the Membrans; But if the Excreſcence be hard and ſtubborn, 'twill be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſet aſide all diſcuſſing or ſuppurating Ingredients, and cut up the skin croſs-ways ſo as not to touch the Membran; then ſeparat the one from the other, and cut out the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bran with the incloſed Tumor by the Root: and after all, ſtop the bleeding and cleanſe the Ulcer, as in other caſes.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes when the nervous Fibres in the Skin are tore
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:207638:329"/>or corroded, they throw out their nutritious Juice which ſettles into <hi>Warts;</hi> and in the Toes of the Feet, where the nutritious Juice of the Bones is ſqueez'd out, into hard Corns. Some of theſe Warts and Corns are fix'd ſo deep into the Tendons, that they cannot be extirpated without incurring the danger of Inflammations, Convulſions or Gangrenes. But others are only ſuperficial and eaſily remov'd. Warts are extirpated by applying the Juice of Celandine, or the Aſhes of Briony mix'd with its Juice, or the Juice of Spurge, ſcarifying the part gently before Application. Some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend an Ointment of Hony with the Spirit of Sulphur, and the Solution of Sal Armoniac in Water, or the Juice that Snails caſt forth when rub'd with Salt; but the beſt method of rooting them out, is to touch 'em with Butter of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony or <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> or rather to burn them out with a hot Iron. If they are pendulous and hang by a ſmall Root, a thread of Silk ty'd about the Root will cut off their nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, and make 'em fall off. As for the venereal Warts that generally invade the Genitals, we apply the Solution of ſublimat Mercury and Allum in Plantain-water.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Corns,</hi> we order the Feet to be waſh'd, and the thick Skin to be ſcrap'd off; then we apply Galbanum or Gum Ammoniac, or the Plaiſter of Hemlock with Mercury ſoften'd in the Oil of Bricks. Some recommend pieces of raw Beef, or Onions mix'd with Soap in the form of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſm. If theſe prove ſucceſsleſs, we apply <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> or Butter of Antimony mix'd with Hony, taking care to defend the neighbouring parts, and take off the <hi>Eſchara</hi> with the Plaiſter <hi>Diachylon</hi> with Gums. But if the Corns lie deep, and be fix'd in the Tendons, 'tis dangerous to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Cauſtics, or to cut them with a Knife; tho in other Caſes, ſuch Operations may ſucceed.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes we meet with ſpungy Swellings about the Joints, that proceed from the nutritious Juice of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brans mix'd with the glutinous Matter that bedews the Joints. The beſt way of curing 'em (if ſo be they admit of a Cure) is to throw aſtringent Pouders upon 'em; ſuch as the Sugar of Lead, Vitriol, Calaminar Stone, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times precipitat Mercury. Stronger Cauſtics, or Emollient Ointments, or manual Section, are for the moſt part very dangerous, by reaſon of their tendency to Cancers.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fourth <hi>Claſs</hi> was allotted for the Tumours of the Blood-Veſſels, which are of two ſorts; 1. Thoſe of the Arteries call'd <hi>Aneuriſma's.</hi> 2. Thoſe of the Veins
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:207638:329" rendition="simple:additions"/>call'd <hi>Varix's.</hi> The former are occaſion'd by cutting the Artery in Blood-letting; or relaxating its Coats by violent Motion, Crying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or by the Corroſion of ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Cauſe; all which are apt to occaſion a Collection of Blood about the injur'd part of the Artery, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Tumor. The Signs are a Swelling riſing gradually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Pulſation of the Artery; if the Artery lie near the Skin, its Color is reddiſh; when the Swelling is preſs'd by ones Finger, it ſinks and diſappears, without it be inveterate. 'Tis cur'd by opening a Vein in the oppoſite part of the Body, avoiding all oily fat things, and applying Bole Armenic, Frankincenſe, Earth of Vitriol, Dragon's Blood, and <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> with a Plate of Lead and a ſtrong Ligature. In <hi>France</hi> they follow a new Method; as for example in the Arm, they ſqueeze the ſuperiour part of the Artery ſo cloſe, that no Pulſe is perceiv'd; then they open the Tumor with a Launce, and remove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geal'd Blood. Having diſcover'd the Wound of the Artery, they apply to it a little ball of Vitriol wrap'd up in Cotton, and the Pouders of Sarcocol, Frankincenſe, and Pine-tree-Roſin with Tow, and above all Bolſters cover'd with the common Digeſtive, and ty'd down with a ſtrong Ligature. The upper Bolſters are renew'd every day; but the Ball of Vitriol which is no bigger than a Pea, and which is inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly diſſolv'd by the Blood that ſoaks thro the Cotton, is ſuffer'd to continue till it fall off.</p>
                  <p>The immediate Cauſe of a <hi>Varix</hi> is the Relaxation and Diſtention of the ſofter Fibres of the Veins. The remote Cauſes are the thickneſs of the Blood, or the Compreſſion of correſponding Veins, as when the Iliac Veſſels being ſtraiten'd by big Bellies, occaſion a <hi>Varix</hi> in the Veins of the Legs. The Diagnoſtics are the Turgidity, and blewiſh Blackneſs of the Veins. It ſeldom requires a Cure unleſs it be painful or threaten a Rupture, Ulcer or Gangrene. If it be very painful, we apply the Ointment <hi>Populeum,</hi> with Mucilages of Flea-wort and Fenugrec-ſeeds, the Oil of Chamomil and Flower of Beans. If they are ulcerated, apply the Plaiſter of Frog's Spawn with Hartſhorn, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincenſe and ſweet Mercury. If the Tumor be very high, and apt to break, open it with a golden or ſilver Needle, and apply a Plate of Lead, or foment with a Spunge ſoak'd in the Decoction of Allum, Salt, and the Fruit of <hi>Acacia</hi> in Vinegar; or apply a Cataplaſm of the Flower of <hi>Lupins,</hi> dry'd Goat's Dung, and Vinegar in which a hot Iron has
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:207638:330"/>been five times extinguiſh'd; remembring ſtill, to tie a ſtrong Ligature about the part. If the <hi>Varix</hi> is open and bleeds exceſſively, apply the Pouder of Hog's Dung, or Clouts dip'd in the Solution of Steel and Allum. In the mean while we ought to take care that the Ligatures do not hinder the Circulation of the Blood, and exhibit inwardly attenuating Sudorific Decoctions.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of Wounds.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE Nouriſhment of wounded parts, and the Blood which flows from 'em, being corrupted by the external Air, become acid, corrode the nervous Fibres, extinguiſh the innate Spirit, and produce all the tragical Conſequents of Wounds.</p>
                  <p>The Wounds of internal parts are diſcover'd by the lame performance of their reſpective Offices, or by the alteration of Excrements voided by 'em. Wounds of ſanguine parts ought to be carefully diſtinguiſh'd from thoſe of the Nerves or Membrans; as alſo the Curable from the Incurable; ſome of which are mortal, ſome not. The mortal are ſaid to be ſuch, either when an internal Bowel eſſential to Life is diſabled, or when the Blood, Spirits, or Vital Juices are too copiouſly evacuated, or thrown upon ſome Cavity from which they cannot be retriev'd.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Wounds of the Heart are not always mortal, without they reach into the Cavities, eſpecially the left: but thoſe of the Lungs, <hi>Bronchia</hi> and Windpipe; of the Middrif, eſpecially its tendonous part; of the internal ſide of the Guller and Orifices of the Stomac; of the Guts (excepting that part of the ſtreight Gut which may be reach'd from without) of the Caul, Sweetbread, and Liver (eſpecially if they reach the large Veſſels) of the Gall, Bladder, and Branches of the choleric Paſſage; of the Spleen, which is full of Arterious Blood; of the Conduit of the Breaſt, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel-ſtring, Kidneys, and the Neck of the Bladder; of the Womb while the Woman is with Child; of the <hi>Medulla</hi> of the Brain, intercoſtal Nerve, <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> and Marrow of the Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, betwixt the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck, and thoſe of the Back: theſe I ſay are all mortal. Thoſe of the Meſentery are curable if the large Veſſels be ſafe: as likewiſe thoſe of the cortical part of the Brain, of the temporal Muſcles, of
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:207638:330"/>the bottom and muſcular part of the Bladder, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour part of the ſpinal Marrow, if it be not cut acro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s.</p>
                  <p>A Surgeon's Duty with reference to Wounds is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the corrupt Blood and Juice that hinders Coalition, to join the divided parts, and apply ſuch vulnerary balmy Ingredients, as preſerve their nutritious Juice from Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now for ſo much as the natural Temperature of the nutritious Juice conſiſts in a temperat oily volatil Salt, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with a Dewy Vehicle, and conſequently its Degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy is juſtly call'd <hi>Acidity;</hi> we ought therefore to keep the Wound ſafe from the Injury of the Air, which has a notable Virtue of creating Acids, and to untye or open it as ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as ever we can. Some Surgeons being more amus'd with the Effect than the Cauſe, chooſe rather to provide for the removal of the Gore and Filth, than be ſo nice in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Wound to the Air. But as their Practice is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable, ſo it ought not to be look'd upon as a Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. The Surgeon's Breath, eſpecially that of drunken Perſons or Women in their Terms, is likewiſe prejudicial to a Wound; and therefore ought to be avoided as well as the Influence of the Moon, which ſtupifies and benums whatever is expos'd to it, as appears by gathering its Rays with a Convex Glaſs.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Corruption of the natural Juice is prevented by applying temperat, volatil, balmy, ſaline Medicines, ſuch as the Balſam of Peru, Turpentin, Oil of St. <hi>John</hi>'s wort, Balſam of Sulphur, and eſpecially <hi>Paracelſus</hi>'s Balſam of Samech prepar'd from the Salt of Tartar volatiliz'd by the Spirit of Wine. The common expreſs'd Oils without they be further prepar'd are pernicious, by reaſon of their latent Acid; as alſo all ſharp volatil Salts, becauſe they increaſe the Pain, melt down and conſume the Nouriſhment of the Part, and hinder Conſolidation. But above all, let <hi>Acids</hi> be ſtrictly prohibited. In the mean while we adminiſter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally Medicines prepar'd from the vulnerary Plants, Dog's Dung, Earthworms, burnt River-Crabs, and the Blood of Goats. Crabs-eyes mix'd with Wine are alſo of good uſe; for they qualify and correct the Acid of the Wine, which of it ſelf is highly pernicious. Nay the chief Virtue of all vulnerary Ingredients is that of ſubduing an Acid; thus Mercury fix'd by Acids is reviv'd by boiling in the Juices of vulnerary Plants.</p>
                  <p>Some are wont to apply Digeſtive ſuppurating Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents to all Wounds; but if the Wound be free of Contuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:207638:331"/>and no heterogeneous Subſtance be lodg'd in it, they are noxious, as cauſing a needleſs Afflux of Matter, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the Wound into an Ulcer. 'Tis true that Wounds receiv'd by a Piſtol, which generally carry Contuſion along with them, or thoſe of the Head which require to be kept open for ſome time, or ſuch as are already ulcerated, require Digeſtives. Such are Turpentin, the Yelk of an Egg, Myrrh, Balſam of Peru, Oil of Roſes, Camphyr, Hony, and in a word, all oily Alcalies, to which we add Abſorbent Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as Chalk, Lead, Copper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After Digeſtion we add ſome ſharper Ingredients for cleanſing the Ulcer.</p>
                  <p>The remaining part of a Surgeon's Office is to take out the heterogeneous Subſtance, if any ſuch there be; and to join the divided parts either by convenient Ligatures, or ſew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'em together. The heterogeneous Subſtance is extracted by proper Inſtruments, or by applying the fat of Hares with Amber and living Crabs, or the dry'd Tongue of a Fox ſoak'd in Wine, or a Plaiſter of Hony, Yeſt, and Miſſeltoe of the Oak: and adminiſtring in the mean while the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerary Decoctions, ſuch as that of Dittany with Crabs-eyes. For joining the ſides of the Wound, we uſe a Fillet of two ends meeting in one Body, which joint Body we apply to the part oppoſite to the Wound, and bring the two ends acroſs upon it, ſo as to join its Lips. Theſe Fillets will ſerve for joining ſimple Wounds that run along with the length of the Fibres; but for large ones that come acroſs the Fibres, or the Joints, or when any part is almoſt cut off to a very Point, then 'twill be needful to few up the Part with a Needle and Thread. But we ought to take care not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſewing up a nervous Part, for fear of inlarging the Pain or pricking a Nerve; as alſo when we few, not to bring the ſides of the Wound, too cloſe, becauſe they are apt to ſwell; and beſides, the purulent matter, if it have not a ſufficient Vent left, will recoil, and create hidden Ulcers, or corrode the Bones.</p>
                  <p>Wounds that come by Pricks rather than Cuts are plied with Tents, which provide for the Incarnation of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote bottom of the Wound, before its ſurface be cover'd with Fleſh. But in applying Tents we ought to obſerve theſe Cautions; 1. They muſt not be too long apply'd, becauſe they retard Conſolidation. 2. In nervous parts they ought not to be long or hard for fear of irritation. 3. They ought not to be too large for fear of rubbing off the Gore which cements the ſides of the Wound, or hurting the
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:207638:331"/>growing tender Fleſh, and denying Reception to the puru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent matter. When the Wound is a cloſing we ought not to be too liberal in applying aſtringent Pouders, becauſe they ſtraiten the Pores, harden the Fibres, and ſo occaſion a Scar or Roughneſs, eſpecially in adult Perſons, whoſe nutritious cementing Juice is not ſo balmy as that of young People. To prevent ſuch Deformities, let the Fat of a Graylin be frequently drop'd into the Wound when it begins to conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate. 'Tis true, that moderat Aſtringents are uſeful for drying up the thin ſerous Humor that accompanies the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritious Juice of the part, cramps its cementing Faculty, and renders the part flaccid, ſoft, and overgrown with luxuriant Fleſh. But in ſimple Wounds, where there is no loſs of Subſtance, they are not ſo very neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, we may juſtly infer from the foregoing Premiſes, that vulnerary Medicines are enrich'd with a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perat volatil oily Salt, and a gentle aſtringent Force, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch as do not of themſelves create new Fleſh, but only preſerve the natural ſtate of the nutritious balmy Juice, which alone is able to conſolidate and repair the loſs. They are preſcrib'd in theſe or the like Forms. Firſt, Internally,</p>
                  <p>Take of River-Crabs, in number twelve; Comfry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roots an Ounce; Leaves of Bugloſs and Ground-Ivy, and Tops of St. <hi>John</hi>'s-wort, of each a handful: Boil them in Water and Wine, and ſweeten the ſtrain'd Decoction with the Syrup of Ground-Ivy; and if a nervous part be wounded, add Oil of Amber. Doſe, ſix Ounces twice a day. Note 1. The ſimple vulnerary Medicines are beſt. Therefore Crabs-eyes and Diaphoretic Antimony; in Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Antimonial Nitre, and in nervous Wounds the Oil or Spirit of Amber, are ſufficient for internal uſe. Note 2. When any heterogeneous Matter is lodg'd within the Wound, or when 'tis very foul, we add to ſuch Decoctions, Savin, Mugwort, Speedwel, Agrimony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and when the Wound is ſufficiently cleans'd, leave 'em out.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Vulnerary Medicines are preſcrib'd for Injecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: As, Take of the Herbs Speedwel, Winter-green, Sanicle and Tobacco leaves, of each two handfuls; Dog's Dung four Ounces. Boil them in Water. Add to the ſtrain'd Liquor Spirit of Wine with Hony, and waſh the Wound with the Mixture.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They're preſcrib'd in the Forms of Oils or Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſams to be drop'd into the Wound; of which the Oil of St. <hi>John</hi>'s wore, Balſam of Sulphur, or that of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru,
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:207638:332"/>and eſpecially <hi>Capaivi,</hi> are infinitely the beſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Ointments: As, Take of Benzoin an Ounce; Spirit of Wine an Ounce and a half; Maſtic a Dram; of the black Balſam, half an Ounce. Make a Liniment. Or, Take of Ear-wax two Drams; Sugar of Lead two Drams: With the expreſs'd Oil of Walnuts make an Ointment. Note 1. Ear-wax is of peculiar uſe for Wounds of nervous parts. 2. Spirit of Wine not over-rectify'd is of admirable Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for preventing Corruption and Conſolidating. Hence <hi>Venice</hi> Triacle mix'd with it and applied to the Wound is much approv'd.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Plaiſters; of which <hi>Paracelſus</hi>'s Oppodeldoch, and <hi>Crollius</hi>'s Styptic Plaiſter are the beſt.</p>
                  <p>Some pretend to cure Wounds by Sympathy; as by mixing the Blood of the Wound with the Vitriol of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per calcin'd by the Sun; or by applying Arſmart to the Wound, it being firſt dip'd in cold Water, and then remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it from the Wound while 'tis hot, and burying it in a Dunghil. But the Colcothar of Vitriol waſh'd and diſſolv'd, infus'd or boil'd in Wine for waſhing the Wound, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a uſeful Medicine.</p>
                  <p>The general Cure of Wounds being thus premis'd, we come next to conſider ſome particular ſorts; as 1. Bruiſes, or thoſe which partake of Contuſion. If the Contuſion be very conſiderable, 'twill be needful to ſcarify the Wound; if not, the common Digeſtives and ſuppurating Medicines will ſufficiently cleanſe it; to which we may add the Oil of Wax, expreſs'd Oil of St. <hi>John</hi>'s-wort, and the Plaiſter of Cummin. Towards the end of the Cure, we may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Spirit of Sal Armoniac, diſtill'd with Quick-lime. —Of this Nature are the Wounds receiv'd from Guns; for ſo much as Bullets tear and bruiſe wherever they come, in curing them we ought firſt to promote Suppuration by applying Tents dip'd in Spirit of Wine, and cover'd with the following Liniment.</p>
                  <p>Take of the Oil of White Lillies four Pound; boil two Puppies in it till their Bones be diſſolv'd; then add of Earth-worms boil'd in Wine a Pound. Boil them together, and when the Liquor is ſtrain'd, add <hi>Venice</hi> Turpentin three Gunces, Spirit of Wine an Ounce and a half. Make a Liniment. After Suppuration is obtain'd, let the Wound be cleans'd with the following Ointment.</p>
                  <p>Take of <hi>Venice</hi> Turpentin five Ounces; Oil of Roſes an Ounce; Hony of Roſes ſtrain'd three Ounces; Myrrh,
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:207638:332"/>Aloes, Maſtic, and round-rooted Birth-wort, of each half a Dram; Flower of Barly three or four Drams. Make an Ointment to be ſprinkled with Spirit of Wine. If the Part be much corrupted, we may add precipitat Mercury. If the Bones be ſeiz'd with Aches after they're cur'd (as it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happens in theſe Wounds) anoint 'em with the Oil of Turpentin. If when the Wound was receiv'd, the Gun was very near the Perſon, the wounded part will be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe burnt; in which caſe Quick-lime-water with the Juice of River-Crabs and Phlegm of Allum is very uſeful.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Malignant and venomous Wounds. The Cauſes are a poiſoned Inſtrument, or the biting of an angry or mad Animal. The Symptoms are an unaccountable Pain, ſudden blewneſs or blackneſs of the Part, and its tendency to a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene; difficulty of Breathing, cold Sweats, Swoonings, Headaches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If the Wound be deep, it muſt be ſcari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd, and <hi>Venice</hi> Triacle with Spirit of Wine applied to it. If it was caus'd by the biting of a Viper, apply a living Toad bruis'd, or the Pouder of a dry'd Toad in Vinegar, and touch the part with a hot Iron, but ſo as not to burn it, and exhibit Urine to drink. For the Bites of mad Dogs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> apply the Stone of an Indian Serpent, or in want of that, <hi>Sala</hi>'s Magnetic Plaiſter mix'd with the Pouder of River-Crabs; or a Cataplaſm of Onyons, Garlic, <hi>Venice</hi> Triacle, and Yeſt. After the Poiſon is extracted, we apply Digeſtives as above. Wounds receiv'd by poyſoned Darts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are cur'd after the ſame manner. In the mean while we admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter internally <hi>Venice</hi> Triacle, Diaphoretic Antimony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with diſtill'd Vinegar.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Wounds of Veins and Arteries. In which the moſt preſſing Indication is to ſtop the Bleeding: For this end we apply ſtyptic Liquors of the Solution of the Vitriol of Steel mix'd with a half quantity of the Solution of Allum in ſome Aſtringent Vehicle; or a mixture of ſtrong Vinegar, Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus of Steel, and the dulcify'd <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> of Vitriol; or above all, the Moſs of a dead Man's Scull, or the Muſhroom call'd <hi>Crepitus Lupi,</hi> tied very hard to the part. If the bleeding be obſtinat, and if there be no Nerves or Tendons in the way, we apply a Cauſtic of Vitriol calcin'd till it become white, mix'd with <hi>Crepitus Lupi.</hi> For Amputations, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatures are of very good uſe. Internally we exhibit nitrous Acids with Aſtringent Tinctures. But in the mean while the Patient muſt carefully avoid all Emotions either of Body or Mind.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="664" facs="tcp:207638:333"/>4. Wounds of the Nerves, or nervous Parts, are very dangerous, by reaſon of their liableneſs to Convulſions, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations, Gangrenes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If a Nerve or Tendon be prick'd, drop into it the diſtill'd Oil of Turpentin mix'd with Spirit of Wine, and Camphyr or Euphorbium. If a Nerve or Tendon be cut acroſs, avoid all Tents, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd Oils, or fat Ingredients; and apply volatil vulne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Balſams ſharpen'd with the diſtill'd Oil of Amber, or the Pouder of Earthworms mix'd with Turpentin, or the Pouder of Snake's Caſt-Coats mix'd with that of Crabs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eyes; or a Mixture of the Oil of Earthworms, Oil of Foxes, Man's Fat and Juice of Earthworms, rubbing the whole Interval betwixt the wounded part, and the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the Nerve. Sometimes when Tendons are cut acroſs, they may be few'd together with a fine Needle, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Example of a late Inſtance of that Nature in <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Wounds of the Breaſt. In curing of which we ought to mind theſe Cautions: 1. That if the Wound be lower than the ſeventh Rib, it belongs to the Belly, and not to the Breaſt. 2. 'Twill be needful to uſe Tents for the Wounds of the Breaſt; but they ought not to be put in during the time of Inſpiration, leſt they be ſuck'd in: and beſides, they ought to have large Heads to prevent their Ingreſs. 3. Internally Dieuretics are very proper, by reaſon that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Breaſt has ofttimes a tendency to paſs by Urine. 4. Antipleuritical Medicines will be alſo very convenient for preventing the Evils that may inſue.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Wounds of the Head: In all which the Belly ought to be kept open. If they're only ſuperficial, let a Plaiſter of Tacamahac, and the Plaiſter of Betony be applied. If the Scull be injur'd, apply the Pouders of the <hi>Flower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de-luce,</hi> Aloes and Myrrh mix'd with Spirit of Wine, or diſtill'd Oil of Turpentin. If the Meninges and Scull be cut quite through, we muſt ſtop the internal Bleeding by the Pouders of Aloes, Frankincenſe, and Bole Armenic mix'd with the Whites of Eggs, and put into the Wound Clouts impregnated with the Oil of Turpentin or Balſam <hi>Capaivi.</hi> Some apply the Oil of Roſes, but that and all fat viſcid Ingredients are abſolutely pernicious. As for Bruiſes of the Head; if they are without Wounds, and are not likely to be diſcuſs'd, we muſt promote their Suppuration, and open 'em very quickly, leſt the ſtagnating matter ſhould injure the Scull. If they are accompany'd by Wounds, but
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:207638:333"/>ſuch as do not injure the <hi>Cranium,</hi> we apply a Digeſtive of Turpentin, Gum <hi>Elemi,</hi> Fat of Beavers, and that of Hogs. If the Scull be hurt by Bruiſes, they cauſe either a Fracture, or a Fiſſure, or Depreſſion of the Bone; of which more anon.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall conclude this Chapter of Wounds, with a few of their moſt remarkable Symptoms. 1. Inflammations of Wounds are cur'd by applying Lime-water or the Juice of River-Crabs with Camphyr and Sugar of Lead. 2. An <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> by applying <hi>Venice</hi> Triacle and Salt of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood diſſolv'd in Spirit of Wine. 3. Luxuriant over-grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fleſh caus'd by the ſpongyneſs and flaggineſs of the Part is remov'd by applying burnt Allum, Crocus Metallorum, the Ointment <hi>Aegyptiacum, Platerus</hi>'s Green Water, or rather the Pouder of the Cryſtals of Silver diſſolv'd in Spirit of Nitre. 4. The Pain which generally attends Wounds of nervous parts is mitigated by applying a Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Oil of Earthworms, diſtill'd Oil of Lavender, and that of Amber. 5. A <hi>Synovia</hi> or Efflux of the nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Juice of the wounded Joints, is cur'd by applying Clouts ſoak'd in the Water diſtill'd from River-Crabs or in a Virgin's firſt Menſtrual Blood; or a Cataplaſm of Hog's Dung boil'd with the Blood of the Wound; or the Moſs of a dead Man's Scull, or <hi>Wurzius</hi>'s brown Ointment; or in the room of 'em all, the following Pouder, <hi>viz.</hi> Take of the Pouder of Oyſter-ſhells an Ounce; Calaminar-ſtone, Cuttle-bones, and Jaw-bones of Pikes, of each two Drams; prepar'd <hi>Spodium,</hi> and ſeal'd-Earth or Allum, of each a Dram and a half. Mix and make a Pouder. 6. Convulſions of wounded parts are cur'd internally as an Epilepſy, and externally by applying the Balſam of Peru with the diſtill'd Oil of Amber, and if a Nerve be prick'd, treating it as above; or if it be imperfectly cut, by cutting it or the Tendon quite through, and ſo ſaving the Perſon's Life, tho at the expence of the Senſe of that Part. 7. The Feavers that attend Wounds are for the moſt part uſher'd in by extraordinary Heat, Redneſs of the Eyes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted pain, and frequent Fluſhing; they're cur'd by Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorifics, ſuch as Crabs-eyes, Diaphoretic Antimony, Coral, and Sal Armoniac mix'd with Nitre and the Juice of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>ULcers are the Corroſion of the Fibres, occaſion'd by a ſharp acid Ferment flowing from the corrupted Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of the Part, or the vicious Blood and Lymph. The Acidity of this corroſive Ferment is ſufficiently made out by the acid Smell of Plaiſters, after they've been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to Ulcers, and the unfitneſs of Alcalin Cauſtics to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode, as being more apt to mortify. In nervous parts, whoſe nutritious Juice is not laden with ſuch a ſtrong volatil Salt, as that of the ſanguine; and in glandulous places, where the Lymph do's naturally incline to Acidity, Ulcers are more troubleſom and dangerous than elſewhere. In Perſons whoſe Blood is degenerat from its volatil State, and become acid, Ulcers are very obſtinat, and ſcarce curable, without the <hi>Craſis</hi> of the Blood be retriev'd. If an Ulcer be clos'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the malignant Ferment be quite drain'd, 'twill either relapſe in the ſame place, or corrupt the adjacent Bones, or diſplay its Energy in another part of the Body. If they be much expoſed to the Air, their Lips become hard and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and ſometimes dry: If they're much diſcolour'd, they ſignify a Gangrene: If they continue long, they cauſe Conſumptions, Feavers, and Ulcers of the Lungs. If the Matter that iſſues from 'em be bloody, thin, ſharp, yellow, or ſtinking, it is not ſo favourable as when 'tis white and thick. When Ulcers become dry, unaccountably, and of a ſudden, they portend imminent Death.</p>
                  <p>Ulcers are cur'd by volatil Acalies and fix'd Abſorbents, which mortify the prevailing Acid. The external Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are of three ſorts. 1. Digeſting. 2. Cleanſing; and 3. Healing. Thoſe of a digeſting Force are the more temperat Alkalies: ſuch as Turpentin, Yelks of Eggs, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtic, Oil of St. <hi>John</hi>'s-wort, Myrrh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and are us'd for qualifying the ſharp bloody matter, and working it into a thick Conſiſtence call'd <hi>Pus.</hi> For the prevailing Acid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts the nutritious Juice of the part into a ſharp thin matter, which ought to be qualify'd by an Alcali, in order to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thick; but ſo as not to deſtroy all the force of the Acid, which entitles it to whitiſh Colour. When the matter is thus prepar'd, we proceed to cleanſing Remedies, that is, ſharper Alkalies that deſtroy the Acid more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:207638:334"/>and hinder the Converſion of the nutritious Juice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to corrupt matter. Their cleanſing Virtue is only acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and leſs to be regarded than that which directly ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles the Cauſes. Of this Nature are the Decoctions of vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerary Plants in Lime-water, or Cataplaſms of the bruis'd Leaves of vulnerary Plants which are infinitely more uſeful than all the Oils, Ointments, and Plaiſters of the Shops; the laſt being of no uſe but for defending the Wound from Air and Cold.</p>
                  <p>Take of Tobacco-leaves two Handfuls; Wormwood-tops and the Herb Speedwell, of each a handful; Roots of round-rooted Birthwort an Ounce; Juniper-berries half an Ounce; Crude Allum from three to ſix Drams. Boil them in Black-Smith's-water, ſtrain the Liquor to be injected into the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, adding at every Injection a convenient quantity of the Spirit of Wine.</p>
                  <p>Take of Lime-water a Pound; Sweet Mercury two Drams; Spirit of <hi>Venice</hi> Triacle camphoris'd an Ounce. Mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take of the Crocus of Steel, prepar'd by Precipitation two or three Drams; Calaminar Stone or ſeal'd Earth a Dram; <hi>Lac Lunae</hi> a Dram and a half; Mace, Myrrh, Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banum and Aloes, of each a Dram; Camphyr half a Dram. Make a Pouder to be ſprinkled with the Spirit of Triacle camphoris'd, and applied to obſtinat Ulcers. A cleanſing Ointment may be prepar'd of the Juices of Tobacco, Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Betony, Hony of Roſes, Aloes, Myrrh, Flowers of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur and Turpentin. If the Ulcers are rotten, or the part much corrupted, the Ointment <hi>Aegyptiacum,</hi> or Verdigriſe with diſtill'd Vinegar will be proper.</p>
                  <p>When the Wound is cleans'd, we apply healing Remedies, which retrieve the natural balmy Juice of the part, cement the Wound, and by a gentle aſtringent Force ſtrengthen the Fibres, and prevent the unſeaſonable Growth of luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Fleſh: Such are the Balſam of Sulphur, expreſs'd Oil of Filberts, Balſam of Pern, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> mix'd with the dulcify'd Earth of Vitriol for benign, and arſenic or precipitat Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury for Malignant Ulcers. But ofttimes oily Ingredients are improper; and therefore we ſhift 'em for Hony and the Juices of vulnerary Plants; and in rebellious Caſes add Quick-ſilver, from which the Spirit of Nitre is drawn off. If the Ulcer be cover'd with luxuriant Fleſh, touch it with <hi>Crocus Metallorum,</hi> or the Cryſtal of Silver diſſolv'd in <hi>Aqua fortis.</hi> If the Ulcer become ſuddenly dry, apply an
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:207638:335"/>Ointment of Turpentin, Hony, Juice of Smallage, and Flower of Beans or Fenugrec. In general the following Plaiſter is of ſingular uſe for conſolidating Ulcers.</p>
                  <p>Take of Maſtic an Ounce; Turpentin three Ounces; yellow Wax four Ounces. Mix, and make a Plaiſter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Art. Or, Take a convenient quantity of Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime waſh'd twice or thrice, and dry'd. Mix it with the Oil of Linſeed, and Bole Armenic, for a Plaiſter.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while 'twill be requiſite to adminiſter vulne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Decoctions and Eſſences inwardly, eſpecially thoſe of River-Crabs, Dog's Dung, Ground Ivy, and Tops of St. <hi>John</hi>'s-wort. To which we add the Decoctions of Sudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rific-woods, the Tinctures of Antimony, the Spirit and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil Salt of Vipers, Myrrh, Saffron, Chalybeat Diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retic Antimony, and Coral or Crabs-eyes exhibited with Vinegar; and interlac'd with Purgatives of Turbith Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or Sweet Mercury with the Extract of Black Hellebor. In deſperat Caſes we muſt have recourſe to a Salivation.</p>
                  <p>Having diſpatch'd the general Cure of Ulcers, we ſhall now deſcend to a few Particulars; as 1. The Ulcers that are attended by a <hi>Caries</hi> or Rottenneſs of the Bones, which muſt be particularly accounted for before the Ulcer can be cur'd. When a <hi>Caries</hi> begins, the Bone appears fat, oily, and yellowiſh; and when it is perfectly rotten, becomes black, uneven, and full of little Holes. If the Bone be not expos'd to one's view either by the naked Eye, or thro a Microſcope, its roughneſs and little Pits are diſcover'd by a Probe. If a <hi>Caries</hi> approach to the Joints, or be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by many nervous parts, 'tis not eaſily cur'd. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Method of Cure is firſt to dilate the Ulcer with Tents of the Roots of Gentian, or the Heart of Elder; then to apply the rectify'd Spirit of Wine, and the Pouder of Euphorbium mix'd with the Root of Florentin Orris, Birthwort, Aloes or Myrrh. The diſtill'd Oil of Guaja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum and that of Cloves are alſo very proper; but all Oils by Expreſſion or Infuſion are pernicious. Injections of warm Plantain-water, in which Sweet Mercury is diſſolv'd, are of excellent uſe for cleanſing the Bone, and fetching off its Scales. But if they prove ineffectual, we muſt either ſcrape the Bone with a Knife till it appear white and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, with the Marks of little Blood-Veſſels; or apply an Actual Cauſtic, the adjacent parts being carefully defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from its Injury. After ſcraping or burning; we apply the Spirit of Wine, or diſtill'd Oil of Cloves.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="669" facs="tcp:207638:335"/>2. Fiſtulas or winding Ulcers with Callous Sides. The Figure and number of their Turnings muſt be carefully trac'd by a ſmall Candle of Wax and Turpentin: If the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Fiſtula be a Bone, it diſcovers it ſelf to the Probe; and if it be painleſs, ſignifies that the <hi>Perioſtium</hi> is broke: If it end in a nervous part, the exquiſit Pain will lead us to the knowledg of it; if in a Blood-Veſſel, the obſcure Colour of the matter will give us to know ſo much. Glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous places are moſt liable to 'em, and unleſs the hardneſs can be remov'd, they prove incurable. Now in order to remove it, and to cleanſe the Ulcer, we firſt dilate the Orifice (which in Callous Ulcers is always narrow) with a Tent of Gentian-roots ſprinkl'd with burnt Allum: then we inject Lime-water with Spirit of Wine; or the Juice of River-Crabs with the Juice of Tobacco and Sweet Mercury; or a Mixture of the Hony of Roſes, Spirit of Wine, and Precipitat Mercury. In inveterat Caſes, we apply the green Waters, or the following Mixture. Take of the Ointment <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acum</hi> half an Ounce; Sublimat Mercury a Dram; Lye four Ounces; Roſe-water an Ounce; Plantain-water four Ounces; Arſenic a Scruple. Boil them till the third part be conſum'd, and apply the Remainder with Tents. If the Pain be ſo violent that theſe Remedies cannot be applied, we muſt lay open the Fiſtulas, and conſume the Callus as above. For a Fiſtula in the Corner of the Eye, call'd <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula Lachrymalis,</hi> the following Mixture is of noted efficacy. Take of prepar'd Tutty a Dram; fine Pouder of Lead and Crude Antimony, of each half a Dram; Ceruſs and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharge, of each a Scruple. With the Cerecloth <hi>Diachalci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidos</hi> mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sordid or rotten Ulcers. In the former the matter is ſlimy, thick, livid or black; in the latter, it ſtinks hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridly. Sometimes Ulcers become fordid thro the indiſcreet Application of far Oils and viſcous Ointments, in which Caſe Cataplaſms of the Dung of Animals with Wine are very ſucceſsful. In general, for all fordid Ulcers, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe ſtrong Cleanſers; ſuch as the Juice of Tobacco or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, Spirit of Wine, the Ointment <hi>Aegyptiacum,</hi> Quick lime-water with Sweet Mercury, or a Precipitat upon which Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine has been frequently diſtill'd.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The inveterate Ulcers in the Legs call'd <hi>Phagedema,</hi> which generally are ſomewhat corroſive and apt to inlarge their Dimenſions. Let 'em be waſh'd with diſtill'd Water of rotten Apples, mix'd with the Extract of Birthwort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roots,
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:207638:336"/>or with rectify'd Spirit of Wine, Sweet Mercury, and Sugar of Lead; or the Decoction of Tobacco in which Allum is diſſolv'd; or the Solution of Precipitat Mercury, or of the Droſs of the <hi>Regulus</hi> of Antimony, in Plantain-water; or the Solution of Gunpouder in Wine. After waſhing, apply the Ointment <hi>Diapompholigos,</hi> and Sugar of Lead, or Precipitat Mercury, with Tents. And anoint the Circumference or Edges of the Ulcer with the rectify'd ſtinking Oil of Man's Dung.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Cancrous Ulcers. Their Cauſes and Symptoms are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for in the Chapter of Tumors. As for their Cure, let the Dung of a Cat fed with River-Crabs; or the Pouder of a Toad and a Lizard calcin'd together in a new cloſe Veſſel; or mix'd with black Pepper, Salt, dry Soot, and Orpine; be ſprinkl'd upon the Ulcer after 'tis waſh'd with Plantane-water. If theſe prove ſucceſsleſs, apply the Oil of Man's Dung, and for the laſt Refuge Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenic fix'd with Nitre, and mix'd with Scot and <hi>Rulandus</hi>'s Balſam of Sulphur in the form of an Ointment, or the Oil <hi>per deliquium</hi> of the Arſenic thus fix'd, it being dulci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd with Spirit of Wine. If the Cancer ſtill continue after theſe Applications, 'twill be needful to cut it off, and then burn out its Roots with a hot Iron; for if the leaſt Particle of the Ferment be left, 'twill revive again. <hi>Alliot</hi> Phyſician to the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> publiſh'd a Schedule at <hi>Paris</hi> ſome years ago, in which he pretended to cure an ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated Cancer without cutting or burning; and that by a certain Alcalin Salt that is ſo fix'd, that it won't diſſolve or melt as the other Alcalin Cauſtics, which by ſo doing exaſperate the Cancer. This Salt he ſays makes an <hi>Eſchara,</hi> and converts the ſharp matter into a laudable Pus.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Ulcers caus'd by Burning. In order to adjuſt their Method of Cure, we ought to diſtinguiſh three degrees in Burning. 1. When the outer Cuticle alone is hurt, and lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in little watry Bladders. This is the ordinary effect of hot Water, burning Straw, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. When the inner Skin is alſo contracted and wrinkl'd. This is the effect of hot Oil, Wax, Pitch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. When the Fleſh it ſelf is burnt, and the Skin caſt into a Cruſt, as by melted Metals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Cure conſiſts in ſubduing the volatil Sulphureous Acid of the Fire which melts down the nutritious Juice of the Part, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the fiery Bladders. For this end we apply for the firſt degree Quick-lime-water prepar'd with the Decoction of Rapes, and mix'd with the Oil of Linſeed to the Conſiſtence
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:207638:336"/>of a thin Ointment; or a Liniment of Quick-lime (fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently waſh'd and purg'd of its ſharp Salt) Tutty, Whites of Eggs, with Vinegar and Oil of Roſes; or the Juice of Onyons or Garlic mix'd with Salt, Caſtle-Soap, and Oil of Roſes. The Mucilage of bruis'd River-Crabs extracted with the Water of Frog's Spawn, or an Ointment of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-Crabs bruis'd and mix'd in a Leaden Mortar with freſh Butter; the Solution of Litharge in Vinegar mix'd with the Oil of Rapes, Camphyr, Mucilage of Quince-ſeeds, and the Whites of Eggs; a Liniment of common Oil mix'd with the Whites of Eggs; or the Syrup of Elder mix'd with Spirit of Wine, are all approv'd in the ſame caſe.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond degree we lay open the Bladder without any delay, and then apply the above-mention'd Medicines, or a Liniment expreſs'd from freſh Hen's Dung fry'd with freſh Butter and Sage, and Plantain-leaves; or a Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Pulp of Apples boil'd in the Water of Frog's Spawn, with Sugar, Camphyr and Saffron.</p>
                  <p>In the third degree we lay open the Puſhes with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſpeed, and apply emollient Liniments for ſeparating the Cruſt, ſuch as Butter mix'd with the Decoction of Mallows, or the Mucilage of Quinces extracted with the Water of Frog's Spawn, and mix'd with Butter, the Oil of Eggs, and that of white Lillies. If the Cruſt do not come eaſily off, it muſt be cut with a Launce, for fear the impriſon'd matter ſhould create a deep Ulcer. After the Cruſt is remov'd, we apply Digeſtives and Cleanſers as in other Caſes.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Of Diſlocations.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE Bones deſign'd for Motion are receiv'd into Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties call'd <hi>Sinus's,</hi> and faſten'd to 'em by Ligaments, Tendons, or Muſcles. And when the Head of any Bone is juſtled out of its proper <hi>Sinus,</hi> 'tis call'd a Diſlocation. The Cauſes are generally external; tho ſometimes a vicious Acid thickening the nutritious Juice that waters theſe Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, may ſtraiten their Capacities, and ſo deny Admiſſion to the Bone, as in the <hi>Sciatica</hi> and Gout; and ſometimes a ſharp ſaltiſh Catarrh, ſuch as Scorbutical Perſons are obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to, by relaxating the nervous Ligaments may indirectly promote a Diſlocation. When a Bone is put out of joint, its Figure, Situation, Length and inability to move will
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:207638:337"/>diſcover it. Some Diſlocations are call'd perfect, when the Bone is quite out of its place; others imperfect, when it ſticks upon the ſide of its Cavity. The former is more difficult to cure than the latter. The Diſlocation of the Thigh Bone, as it dos not eaſily happen by reaſon of the extraordinary Strength of its Ligament; ſo 'tis hard to cure, the Muſcles being very thick, and the part in a manner inacceſſible. But that of the ſmall Bones about the Ankle is much more dangerous, they being ſurrounded with many Tendons, which, when they're miſplac'd, are apt to create grievous Pain, Inflammations, Convulſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When a Bone is ſet, let the contracted Muſcles be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to their due Length, and the whole Member be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently ty'd faſt with broad or narrow Swathes, as its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture requires, remembring ſtill not to tie it too hard, nor to apply Aſtringents (as moſt Surgeons are wont to do) leſt the Stagnation of the Blood or Serum ſhould occaſion In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations or Tumors. If the part be much inflam'd, we muſt not pretend to extend it, or to ſet the Bone, till the Inflammation be abated by the following Decoction.</p>
                  <p>Take of the Tops of St. <hi>John</hi>'s-wort, a handful and a half; of the Herbs Betony, Chamomil, and Roſemary, of each a handful; Comfrey-roots three Ounces; Roots of round-rooted Birth-wort ſix Drams; the four large hot Seeds, of each an Ounce and a half. Boil them in Water, and add to a Pound and a half of the ſtrain'd Liquor, ſix Ounces of Wine, in which Sage has been infus'd. Mix and foment the part, and after 'tis ty'd up, wet the Swathes with a Spunge dip'd into it. If the Pain be exceſſive, we may add Poppy-Heads to the Decoction. In the mean while give internally volatil Alcalies and fix'd Diaphoretics, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the Stagnation of the Blood.</p>
                  <p>If a white Swelling invade the part, either before or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Bone is ſet, anoint it with the diſtill'd Oil of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, or of Man's Bones rectify'd with burnt Hartſhorn. However, in all Caſes let expreſs'd Oils and Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Cataplaſms be avoided; the former ſhut the Pores and relaxat the Fibres; and the latter cauſe Inflammations and Tumours. The common Plea for Aſtringents is, that they ſtrengthen the Fibres: Whereas the Fibres are much more benefited by fomenting 'em with Aromatic and nervous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions, and applying Cephalic Plaiſters of Amber, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi, Balſam of Peru, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If the Diſlocation be caus'd by the internal Coagulation of the nutritious Juice of the Joint,
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:207638:337"/>'tis incurable, unleſs Mercury give relief. If it be only threaten'd, we endeavour to prevent it by giving inwardly the volatil Preparations of Tartar, eſpecially its Spirit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd from Tartar fermented with its own Alcaly; to which we may add Sal Armoniac, and the Spirit and volatil Salt of Man's Bones. Externally we apply the Spirit of Earth-worms mix'd with Spirit of Sal Armoniac; and in a word, whatever was recommended for the <hi>Sciatica.</hi> Particularly the following Oil,</p>
                  <p>Take of the diſtill'd Oil of Man's Bones one part; ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Oil of Tartar two parts. Mix 'em with Quick-lim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and diſtil, through a Retort, a moſt penetrating Oil.</p>
                  <p>If the Relaxation of the Ligaments occaſion'd by a ſaltiſh Serum threaten a Diſlocation, adminiſter inwardly <hi>Poterius</hi>'s Diaphoretic Gold, the Spirit of Earthworms, Eſſence of Saſſafras, and <hi>Sal Volatile Oleoſum;</hi> and rub externally with the Spirit of Earthworms and the Oil of Earth, applying a Plaiſter of Tacamahac and Caran ſoften'd with the Oil of Amber, or <hi>Crollius</hi>'s Styptic Plaiſter mix'd with Stone Oil.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. V. <hi>Of Fractures.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>BONES are broken moſtly by external Cauſes; tho there are ſome uncommon Inſtances of Fractures occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd by violent internal Convulſions. Some Fractures come acroſs the Bone, and frequently cauſe Splinters, which gall the nervous Parts moſt ſenſibly; and ſometimes wound the Skin. They are eaſily diſcover'd by their extreme pain, loſs of Motion, the contraction and diſtortion of the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Fibres, the inflammations and ſoft ſwellings of the Part, and by feeling with one's fingers, eſpecially if the Bone be out of its place. But the Inflammations that attend 'em at firſt, ought to be diſtinguiſh'd from the <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> that ſometimes appears about the fourth day, being uſher'd in by ſhiverings, and accompany'd by a Feaver, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from the growing Acidity of the nutritions Juices of the injur'd Membrans, which provoke 'em to Contractions, and ſo waken all the Juices in the Body. Other Fractures are more properly <hi>Fiſſures, viz.</hi> When the Bone is ſplit lengthways. The Symptoms of a Fiſſure are theſe. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Pain gradually ſeizes the Bone, but 'tis ſtill capable of performing its wonted Offices: Afterwards a ſmall reddiſh
<pb n="674" facs="tcp:207638:338"/>Tumor appears, eſpecially if the Fiſſure be great; the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritious Juice of the Bone runs out of the Cleft, and glides along the Member, till the Tendons about the Joints thwart its Paſſage, and oblige it to ſtagnat, and ſo become an Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. In the mean while the Bone it ſelf where 'tis ſplit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes rotten, and feeds the Ulcer with continual ſupplies of corrupt matter tho at ſome diſtance. Therefore a Surgeon ought to be very cautious in all Ulcers lying near the Joints, to examin the Bone narrowly, and inquire after the above-mention'd Symptoms, ſince Ulcers proceeding from Fiſſures can never be cur'd, 'till the diſtant Cauſe be trac'd out and accounted for.</p>
                  <p>As touching Prognoſticks: Fractures in the middle of the Bone without Wounds or Splinters, are more favourable than thoſe about the Joints, or where the two joining Bones are both broke, or where the Bone is beaten to pieces, and the Wounds, whether occult or manifeſt, threaten Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. Fractures about tendonous places are very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. The Bones of the Thigh ſeldom conſolidat, being cloſely block'd up by bulky Muſcles. The time of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union of broken Bones is uncertain as depending upon the difference of Ages and Conſtitutions. Women with Child are not eaſily cur'd, but after Delivery their Cure ſucceeds.</p>
                  <p>When a Bone is broken acroſs, 'tis the Surgeon's Office to extend the Member, and join the two ends together, faſtening 'em with proper Ligatures, and ordering an eaſy Poſture of the Part according to the cuſtom of the Patient. Thus the two ends of the broken Bone being laid together, the nutritious Juice will ſtagnat betwixt 'em, and gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly harden into a Subſtance of equal Conſiſtence joining 'em together. If the Part be inflam'd, nothing can be attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards ſetting, till the Inflammation be remov'd. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 'tis ſet, bathe it with the Spirit of Wine mix'd with a third part of the Spirit of Earthworms; or anoint it with the Oil of Earthworms, diſtill'd Oil of Roſemary, and the Oil of Man's Fat rectify'd upon Man's Bones; apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterwards a Plaiſter of Tacamahac ſoften'd with the diſtill'd Oil of Roſemary; or the common Plaiſter of white Roſin, Turpentin, Pouders of Snakeweed and Birthwort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roots, the Extract of round-rooted Birth-wort prepar'd with Spirit of Wine, and diſtill'd Oil of Amber. The Plaiſter muſt be ſo applied that its two ends do not come quite together, leſt they ſhould ſuppreſs the Tumors that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways happen. If the Part be bruis'd, apply Hony with
<pb n="675" facs="tcp:207638:338"/>the Spirit of Wine. After the Plaiſter is applied, tye it down with Swathes and Splents, but the Swathes muſt not be too hard tied, nor the Splents too many. Aſtringent Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſms are generally us'd, but to the detriment of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. If Cataplaſms are demanded, let 'em be made of the Leaves of the Herb <hi>Robert</hi> bruis'd, or of the Pouder of Snakeweed-roots with Wine.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while 'twill be proper to exhibit inwardly vulnerary Decoctions, eſpecially of Roſemary, Agrimony, Savin, and the Herb <hi>Robert.</hi> The Stone of <hi>Oſteocolla</hi> given to a Dram in Wine or Vinegar is of ſingular uſe.</p>
                  <p>As for Fiſſures; the divided parts of the Bone muſt be join'd, the above-mention'd Plaiſter applied, and the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber tied up with Swathes. If a Tumor beſet the Part, let it be open'd, and treated as a Fracture with a Wound. If an Ulcer happen, lay it open to the very Fiſſure, and cleanſe the rotten Bone and Ulcer as above.</p>
                  <p>If a Fracture be attended by a Wound, it muſt be kept open for ſome time, to give vent to the pieces of Bones that do not conſolidate with the reſt. If the Bone hang out at the Wound, and be not tainted by the Air, it ought to be put into its proper place; if otherwiſe, it muſt be ſaw'd off, or otherwiſe ſeparated. The Separation may be promoted by the following Liniment.</p>
                  <p>Take of Aloes and Myrrh, of each half a Dram; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fry and Birthwort-roots, of each three Drams; <hi>Euphorbium</hi> two Drams: With Turpentin and Wax make a Liniment.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the Callus which joins the Bones is too bulky, and cauſes a Deformity, which may be help'd while 'tis ſoft and green; but it if be confirm'd, there's no relief: For if a new Fracture be endeavour'd, it will not fall upon the Callus, but near to it.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Of a Gangrene and</hi> Sphacelus.</head>
                  <p>A Gangrene and <hi>Sphacelus</hi> differ only gradually; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer being an imperfect, the latter a perfect Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They are equally the Conſequents of all the preceding Diſorders, <hi>viz.</hi> Tumors, Wounds, Ulcers, Diſlocations and Fractures; and therefore ſeem'd to claim a peculiar Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to themſelves. Their immediat Cauſe is a prevailing Alcali that deſtroys the innate volatil Acid, and diſſolves its
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:207638:339"/>Sulphur. The remote Cauſes are, whatever prevents the Influx and Circulation of the Blood and Animal Spirits, which are wont to recruit the volatil Acid, as Ligatures, Bruiſes, Wounds, Cold, or the ſudden Contraction of the Pores, Poyſon, malignant Diſeaſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Symptoms are theſe. At firſt the Arteries beat very high in the Part, but the Pulſation, Heat and Senſe dwindle gradually away; the Muſcles become ſoft and flaccid, and ſeparat, as it were, from the Skin, whoſe Color becomes pale, blew, and at length black. If an Ulcer degenerat into a Gangrene, it voids no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Matter; or if there be any, 'tis diſcolour'd and fetid. If a Gangrene proceed from an internal Cauſe, 'tis incurable; for tho the Part be cut off, 'twill revive elſewhere. Nervous parts are more liable, and more difficult to cure than the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine. Sometimes a Tendon, when ſeiz'd by a Gangrene, may be mov'd by the Muſcle, which being long and at ſome diſtance is not touch'd, and therefore Motion is no certain ſign of a ſound part.</p>
                  <p>For Cure. In a <hi>Sphacelus</hi> the mortified part muſt be cut off. In a recent Gangrene, we muſt prevent its progreſs; internally by exhibiting the Spirit of Triacle camphoris'd, Spirit of Wine camphoris'd, Spirit of Juniper-berries, Spirit of Hartſhorn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and externally by applying the Spirit of Wine camphoris'd with Myrrh, Aloes and Frankincenſe; or the Decoction of Quick-lime mix'd with Spirit of Wine, and Sweet Mercury; or the Decoction of the Droſs of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in Vinegar; or the Decoction of Lupines with White Wine, Lye and Saffron. Cataplaſms of Germander, Wormwood, Hyſſop, Sage, Agrimony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> boil'd in Lime-water, and Clouts dip'd in the Decoction of the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> of <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> in Roſe water, are alſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. If the Gangrene be far advanc'd, let the part be ſcarify'd, and waſh'd with the following Mixture.</p>
                  <p>Take of Pickle four Ounces; Spirit of Wine campho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris'd two Ounces: Ointment <hi>Aegyptiacum</hi> an Ounce. Mix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After 'tis waſh'd apply the Butter of Antimony, or ſublimat Mercury with Myrrh, Aloes, Allum, and the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> of Vitriol, or precipitat Mercury boil'd with the Oil of Nuts. Some extol the following Cataplaſm.</p>
                  <p>Take of Wormwood-tops, Chamomil, and Elder-flowers, of each a handful and a half; of the Herb Germander a handful and a half; Rue half a handful; Horſe-dung three Ounces. Boil them in Pickle, adding in the end two Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Ink, and three Ounces of the Spirit of Wine.</p>
                  <pb n="677" facs="tcp:207638:339"/>
                  <p>In a <hi>Sphacelus</hi> the mortified part muſt be cut off with all convenient Speed, without waiting (as ſome do) till it come to the Joint. Some perform Amputations with red hot In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, thinking thereby to prevent the exceſſive bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; others are content with cold Inſtruments, and ſtop the bleeding with the Pouder of Hog's Dung, and dulcify'd Earth of Vitriol; or with Clouts dip'd into a Mixture of the Vitriol of Steel and Allum with the Juice of Plantain.</p>
